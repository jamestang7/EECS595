jackie brown ( miramax - 1997 ) starring pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , michael bowen , chris tucker screenplay by quentin tarantino , based on the novel rum punch by elmore leonard produced by lawrence bender directed by quentin tarantino running time : 155 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( " $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn " ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel " rum punch " ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . 
 a miramax pictures release . starring robin williams , matt damon , ben affleck , stellan skarsgard , minnie driver , casey affleck , cole hauser , george plimpton . script by ben affleck and matt damon . produced by lawrence bender . directed by gus van sant . running time : 125 mins . rated r . " good will hunting " is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , " prodigy child " film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick . unusually directed by gus van sant , " good will hunting " overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent . the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams . in a nutshell , that's it . the core of the " good will hunting " is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by " chasing amy's " ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer . but it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( " awakenings " was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death . damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein . his rich , complex character is the pulp of " good will hunting . " everything else pales in comparison . " good will hunting " exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike " little man tate " or " phenomenon " , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned . 
 one of the best-ever names for a holiday special ( sure as hell beats frosty returns ) hits home video a year after its tv premiere , in this animated production from simpsons creator matt groening . based on a book by j . otto seibold and vivian walsh , olive's a hip dash of christmas humor and fun amidst specials that have just made little kids cry all these years . see , olive's not really a reindeer - she's a dog . a strange dog . voiced by drew barrymore , she speaks english to her owner tim ( jay mohr ) , doesn't dig for bones , and won't chase cars . while listening to the radio on christmas eve , she hears that santa may cancel his delivery , as blitzen is injured . he announces ( in a 90's soundbite ) , that he'll just have to rely on " all of the other reindeer . " olive is so caught up in the holidays , she thinks santa is talking about her . even her pet flea can't believe it . once it's set that she's really a lonely misfit -- a holiday story staple -- she's off to the north pole with a shifty penguin named martini ( the matrix's joe pantoliano ) . they catch a " mauvehound bus " driven by a weirdo named richard stands ( snl's tim meadows ) , who once thought the pledge of allegiance was for him ( say it out loud ) . but it's not just an easy bus trip that'll get olive to santaland . our villain is a demented mailman ( simpsons veteran dan castellaneta ) who just goes postal during the holiday season due to the weight of the all his deliveries . he'd love for santa's cancellation to hold up , so he's on his own quest to stop olive and company . as with any good simpsons episode , groening's writer -- simpsons and david letterman staffer steve young -- fills the story and landscape with bad puns and inside visuals that welcome the adults into the action just as much as the kids . the laughs don't have the stinging irony of the simpsons , but they are certainly playful enough to hold most viewers' interest . as is the animation , a freaky mix of multi-dimensional backgrounds and flat characters . it looks like a strange combination of a kid's video game and a set of colorforms , giving it a splashy , original look . there are a few musical numbers that whiz by , most notably the postman's lament about delivering the mail ( the best lyrics in the feature ) , and a ditty headed by rem's michael stipe , singing as schnitzel the reindeer . just a few minutes into olive , i wondered why drew barrymore was voicing our hero . she's not really a voice actor , and doesn't sound too expressive . then i read that she and partner nancy juvonen are also executive producers on this special . drew may want to audition a few others next time . but , like most of olive , drew's voice grew on me . this is a special that's hard not to enjoy , and it thankfully avoids any sappy finale . it may not enter the pantheon of holiday classics , but it's just too damn cute not to watch once a year . especially when olive wags that little tail . that's great . 
 " a dream of dark and troubling things . " -- david lynchthere are those who say " eraserhead " makes little sense , and then there are those who say that " eraserhead " isn't supposed to make sense . i'm with the second camp : if " eraserhead " made any sense at all , it wouldn't be nearly as interesting . " eraserhead " is allegedly a horror movie , but i put it instead on that small shelf of films that abandon all pretense at being entertainment and just give you an experience : " begotten " , " the reflecting skin " and alejandro jodorowsky's head-trips ( " el topo " , " the magic mountain " ) are close cousins in spirit to this film . there is a story , sort of . henry spencer ( lynch regular john nance ) is a nerdish , creepy-looking man living in a squalid little apartment . he's accidentally impregnated his girlfriend , and the baby turns out to be a vile little creature that looks something like e . t . after thalidomide . the news about the pregnancy , by the way , comes out during a dinner where the main course consists of chickens the size of one's fist that still move and spurt blood when sliced into . there's also a strangely deformed woman who seems to live in henry's radiator . . . and by this point you're either shaking your head in dismay or wondering where to find the movie . i guess that means i've done my job . " eraserhead " needs to be seen on the big screen to work properly . on tv , the black-on-black photography -- this is the single darkest movie ever made , and i don't just mean in terms of subject matter ! -- reproduces very poorly . also , on tv , the black and white images don't saturate the senses the way they do in a theater . there's also the most creative use of sound in almost any movie i've ever seen : not a single scene in the film is silent . there's always something rumbling , hissing , clattering , bubbling , booming away in either the background or the next room over , and it has the same effect on the audience's nerves as a dentist's drill . before david lynch started screwing with america's mind via " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " , he spent five years , on and off , making " eraserhead " . it shows . there is a level of obsessive care in every frame of this film that many movies costing hundreds of times more don't show at all . people may wonder : if this thing's so weird and so repulsive , why did i give it three and a half stars ? because it dares to be different and succeeds . i don't automatically reward every movie that's " experimental " with a positive review , but they sure deserve the benefit of the doubt . -----------== posted via deja news , the discussion network ==---------- http : //www . dejanews . com/ search , read , discuss , or start your own 
 what starts out as a monotonous talking-head musical history lecture turns into a rich land of louisiana discovery , as robert mugge adventures into the various landscapes of that colorful state . three different sections of louisiana are documented along the journey , northern , southern , and southwestern louisiana , separated by maps and cutesy subtitles . the latter two are the best installments , in that they allow the charismatic performers direct camera time without the interference of a boring onscreen interviewer . each county has a different character , style , instruments , and sound , all distinct in their origins , as local experts tell us , and mugge respectfully picks up these discerning traits . where one town declares that race isn't an issue , the other shows how racial tensions actually aided in black and white musicians inspiring one another . southern louisiana has a strong cajun/creole base , while northern louisiana leans towards guitar and a cappella singing . as a whole , this documentary is well layered with performance and testimony but could easily have been shorter and made the same impact on an audience . in the first section especially , numerous concert performances run superfluously through an entire song , with the camera panning to and fro , looking for something to do . every person put in front of the camera is introduced , but only half the multitude leave much of a mark . the director of the louisiana folk festival expounds on the glories of louisiana's past for an interminable period of time , but most of what he says goes in what ear and out the other . on the other hand , there's a remarkably short section devoted to a 28-year disc jockey veteran , sister pearlee tolliver . she spends her two hours on the radio exclaiming commercials in a gospel voice , with a couple of records thrown in , and she amuses too much to forget . as standard documentaries go , the expected talking heads are mixed in with live concert performances . but most endearing are the discussions with actual performers about their influences and playing style , and reminiscences about their colleagues . these interviews , juxtaposed with the local connoisseurs , provide a solid foundation for the musically ignorant and die hard fan . one of the best portraits is that of kermit ruffins , a local favorite in southwestern louisiana . he takes the historical roots of jazz and blues and mixes them with his own modern experiences growing up in the streets . popularity hasn't blown his ego either , as once in a while he barbeques for his audience out of the back of his truck . other details compliment this musical voyage . the first record store in louisiana , floyd's , is renowned for shipping impossible-to-find music all over the world . the original owner still runs it and helps to promote new talent such as rosie ledet . rosie was a housewife who taught herself how to play the accordion and she now sings and tours with her husband's band . at once mousy and humble , this lady has gone on to break ground for female artists in the zydeco field . before walking into to this film , one might think that all of louisiana could be clumped into a simple stereotype . it takes a while to be interested in the material , but once the filmmaker moves onto southern louisiana , it's hard to look away from the screen . 
 a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb . men in black is a four-star three-star film . ( hope you could follow that one ) men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " . nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof . naturally nobody believes his story . . . nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib . edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . james edwards no longer exists . meet agent jay . agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties . eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does . barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely . it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed . a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me ! 
 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . 
 on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . he is insane , apparently . the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax . but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . bad cutting puts the timing way out . in other words , he's almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . proof that he can do it , if he tries . . . 
 starring : ashley judd , tommy lee jones , annabeth gish , bruce greenwood , michael gaston . rated r for violence , language and some sexuality . underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . he is a man who has had his share of bad things . while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . whatever happens the film was excellent to me . i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . reviewed by brandon herring october 13 , 1999 . brandon herring movie review heaven ( http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html 
 as south park : bigger , longer and uncut opens , the citizens of the famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune . the birds are chirping , the sun is shining , and the friendly inhabitants are smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune . enter the foursome of cartman , kyle , stan and kenny , the infamous group of elementary school children that the tv show is based upon . they see an ad bearing the names of their favorite fart-lighting duo of terrance and phillip , who are appearing in their very first feature length movie ( a canadian production ) . and so they venture forth to the local cineplex , where they are shamefully turned down from seeing this graphic , r-rated feature . after bribing a homeless man to accompany them as their `parental guardian' , the boys make it in to watch the movie , unaware that the profane language they learn will soon thereafter destroy their quiet and peaceful town . south park is a tv show that grew immensely popular on comedy central . mostly , of course , with the less demanding younger viewers , who found the idea of swearing and offensive cardboard children to be just their cup of tea . now that co-creators trey parker and matt stone are free of their television rating confines , they have pushed the envelope as far as it can possibly go . the south park movie is more raunchy , vulgar and repeatedly crude than anything you have probably ever seen . the obscenities flow so consistently that unwilling viewers may be scarred for life , left to babble on in profane gibberish . the reason the film exists is that parker and stone can take revenge on the mpaa ( that's the motion picture association of america ) , with whom they've experienced a complicated past . but , they won't stop there . how many groups , minorities and individuals does the south park movie stab in the back ? with the exception of the mpaa , there is ( ahem * ) black people , jewish people , gay people , anne murray , celine dion , jar jar binks , the baldwin brothers , saddam hussein , brian boitano , bill gates , barbara streisand , and most blatantly of all : canada ! parker and stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we canadians , from speech patterns to flag-wearing and beyond . it would be advisable for anyone who is easily offended to avoid this film , at all costs . but back to the plot . after the south park children begin to utter shocking four-letter words as part of their regular vocabulary , the mothers take action . forming mac ( mothers against canada ) , they take their case to president clinton , forcing him to proclaim war on the neighboring country for polluting the american children's minds with their obscene movie productions . terrance and phillip are thereby scheduled to be executed , with a pre-celebrity bash including winona ryder and big gay al . the south park children decide to band together , stop the bloodbath , and save the lives of their acting icons before all is lost . let me first say that i laughed . lord help me , i nearly busted a gut during some uproarious musical numbers . yes , in case you didn't know already , the south park movie is basically a feature-length animated musical . the lyrics are often side-splitting and many of the songs have an enjoyable beat , especially the re-enactment of the widely cherished `kyle's mom's a b--ch' , performed with eager enthusiasm by cartman himself . as a sub-plot , kenny sets himself on fire while attempting to light his own fart , and descends to hell . there he meets satan , who is having a heated affair with none other than saddam hussein . for such ( intentionally ) crummy animation , there are some impressive computer-generated visuals down below . unfortunately , this and many other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into disgusting vulgarity . south park : bigger , longer and uncut nearly received an nc-17 from the mpaa , and for good reason ; this film is not for young audiences . while a half-hour episode is nicely filling , the 90-minute movie begins to lose fuel as it nears the conclusion . but some sequences are so hilarious , and some pop culture references so cleverly placed , you just have to appreciate the effort . south park : bigger , longer and uncut breaks every rule in the book , and if you have the courage , you just might find it entertaining . 
 krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 
 tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . that's a shocking 100 times profit ! rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . tbwp is simply smart . filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . simply amazing in that respect , i must say . talk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . you have to see it for yourself . i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! 
 capsule : starts off as a legal thriller , but mutates into something much closer to the heart -- and features gene hackman in a typically excellent performance . some movies lead you wrong , and that's a good thing . the chamber , adapted from the john grishamn novel , starts off as a typical legal-thriller-with-a-twist , but then slowly turns into a different sort of story , about one man trying to find the truth about the past and another man trying to find the truth about himself . the two men are adam hall , a young chicago laywer , and his grandfather , sam cayhall . cayhall is a product of the worst breeds of southern racism , in whose fold he built and detonated several bombs . " i never meant to kill anyone , " he repeats angrily , but bombs are generally not designed to do much else , and three trials and countless appeals later , he is now on death row . hall , his grandson , has decided to take on the eleventh-hour defense . hall and cayhill do not like each other . cayhill has no use for lawyers -- most of the reasons , it seems at first , are blatantly racist , and don't bear repeating here ( even though they are delivered with consummate skill by hackman ) . hall doesn't like the bitter old man , but he smells a great deal is being held away from a lot of people's noses here , and digs . he finds a lot . as the movie unwound , i felt it could have gone one of two ways : either it could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish ( the way the dreadful a time to kill ended up ) , or it could pay closer attention to the people in the story . it takes the second road , and is all the better for it . and be warned : as a result , we don't get a nice , tidy conclusion -- a lot of threads are left dangling , probably deliberately , since the real conclusion of the movie is in the way hackman's character handles his oncoming fate . eventually we see that his racism is not so much a philosophy as a way of warding off terrible grief and hurt , and self-hatred ( as is the case with most virulently racist people , they compensate violently for not having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis ) . hall ( played by chris o'donnell with maturity and grace ) also has a transformation of his own , but a smaller one : sometimes it's not possible to use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong , just to comment on it . he resents his grandfather for using the same tired excuses , but at the same time batters patiently at the man's defenses , knowing that it's only a matter of time before the imminence of the clock will get him to say something true to his heart . he does .

" the tailor of panama " is a different kind of spy movie . despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carrÃƒÂ© , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . osnard offers harry a way out . he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . osnard turns in reports about the " silent opposition , " a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . the metropolis , described by one character as " casablanca without heroes " pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . " the tailor of panama " succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . 
 review by scott hunt . visit me at movie hunt http : //netdirect . net/~hunt/index . html cast : chow yun-fat , jodie foster , bai ling director : andy tennant writer : anna leonowens , steve meerson , peter krikes anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . anna function is to help provide that link . the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . it shows a seduction of intelligence . ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 
 scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . . . scream 2 ! 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled " stab " , which has been developed into a major motion picture . as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of " stab " , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown " copycat " sets out to repeat what's been done . . . and finish what hasn't ! of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . i will note , however , that the " whodunit ? " did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . all the actors outdo themselves here . we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . like they say , don't mess with perfection . . . but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ? 
 when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other " martial arts " flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . 
 rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odoen ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by uip on april 7 , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 126 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by stephen soderbergh ; produced by danny devito , michael shamberg , stacey sher . written by susannah grant . photographed by ed lachmann ; edited by anne v . coates . it's astounding , how many of us turn into lawyers when we get wrapped up in cases . i remember the louise woodward affair , for example , when i knew all the evidence from the courtroom pictures on tv , and was able to reel off detailed arguments crushing people who had just looked at her and assumed she was guilty . passion about justice is what makes people consider law careers ; it chills me when i see sell-outs trying to condemn obviously innocent people , or using dishonest tactics to help the guilty . stephen soderbergh's " erin brockovich " is a brilliant story of anger turning into courtroom skills ; a david versus goliath-style exposÃƒÂ© in the great tradition of " silkwood " , " a civil action " and " the insider " . at its centre is a woman with no judiciary training or expertise , whose mind was not complicated with red tape or histories of statutes , and whose discoveries and simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the biggest lawsuits in american history . her name , of course , is erin brockovich ( julia roberts ) , and when we meet her in the opening scenes of this film , she's just a struggling single mother who has failed to win a personal injury settlement . soon after , she hustles her way into a filing job at the firm of her solicitor . the boss , ed masry ( albert finney ) , objects , but erin makes her services hard to refuse : " i need a job . don't make me beg . if it doesn't work out , fire me . " when handling the real estate documents of a town in california , erin notices something odd -- they all include medical records . researching this further , she stumbles on the information that the area's water supplier , pacific gas & electric , has been using a dangerous chemical known as 'hexavalent chromium 3' in their pipes . 'chromium 3' can penetrate the body to cause pretty much any illness , including all forms of cancer . what's especially horrific is that pg&e knew about the hazards of their water and misinformed its customers that chromium was good for them . the people took the company's word , even when they all started to get sick , until erin brockovich revealed her findings , and used her common touch to encourage the folks to stand up and take legal action . brockovich is not always a likeable character . at the start of the movie , when no job interviewers will look past her lack of a resumÃƒÂ© or qualifications , her feeling of victimisation is preposterous . she seems to think anyone who isn't stuck in the poverty trap must be some sort of snob . and she displays gross arrogance when defending her wardrobe , which is made up of mini-skirts , tight boob tubes and high-heeled boots . " as long as i have one ass instead of two , " she tells masry when he points out that his office has a dress code , " i'll wear what i god damn well please . " but none of these flaws take away from her achievement , which is that she worked hard , taught herself some tough skills , became a great friend and advocate for victims of an abominable crime , and managed to raise a family at the same time . this is one of roberts's most impressive performances , her best since " pretty woman " ( 1990 ) , because she really does look affected by the pressures her character has to cope with . she allows herself to be vulnerable , with a voice that can quiver and stumble . she doesn't always have the answers , and could break down at any minute . there are one or two irritating episodes of grandstanding , where she rattles off snappy , heroic speeches that probably took the screenwriter hours to write ; but that's kind of obligatory , and i'm just glad that such moments don't dominate the film . " erin brockovich " is not necessarily better than the films i previously mentioned , but has advantages over each of them in one way or another . it's more fast-paced and accessible than " silkwood " , angrier about its subject matter than " a civil action " and less sidetracked than " the insider " . i'm starting to love director soderbergh's new visual style , too , which he also used in " out of sight " , and mixes the colour palette and star power of big studio movies with the documentary camera and quiet pacing of realistic independents . sounds distracting . but it's oddly compelling . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic's website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic 
 starring steve martin , eddie murphy , heather graham , christine baranski , jamie kennedy , robert downey jr . , and terrence stamp . the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money . in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger . he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . will bowfinger be able to make his film ? or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . 
 hype ? sheesh , like no other . this side of titanic , good will hunting has enjoyed some of the most baffling , gushing praise of the year . does either film deserve it ? not really . let's look at the facts : you have matt damon as will hunting -- apparently the smartest man on the face of the earth who can also kick anyone's ass over breakfast , and has a history of run-ins with the law . oh no ! affleck is his down-to-earth best bud . driver , the hoity-toity love interest . williams and skarsgÃƒÂ¥rd as hunting's mentors , the guys that rescue him from a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer . and it is made abundantly clear that the film is also about the class stuggle in boston . now that i've typed it out , it sounds ridiculous , and the more i think about it , the more it really * is * . the plot and theme of good will hunting hinge upon the idea that it's tough for the smartest man in the world to make the move from crumb-bum to respectable member of society . why ? because ( a ) " just because he has a gift he doesn't have to use it ! " and ( b ) he had a troubled childhood . well , boo hoo ! the more i write , the more it sounds like a topic on " jenny jones " : boy geniuses on the wrong side of the tracks . right . if any believable character had this guy's abilities , this movie would have been much different . . . and probably much shorter , too . i realize i'm ranting here , but the pop psychology of hunting reaches such a high level of annoyance so that when williams tearfully confronts damon with the film's signature line of -- i kid you not -- " it's not your fault , " it just gets silly . and it lost me . the script , written by damon and affleck , is otherwise humorous and keeps you entertained . van sant's direction is inexplicably amateurish and features some lousy voice dubbing . williams is pretty good in his role , and for what it's worth , so is damon , even though the character is ludicrous . all told , the film has plenty of enjoyable moments , but it's just not the deep experience the filmmakers want you to believe it is . and neither was titanic . that ought to guarantee me plenty of hate mail for the next few weeks . fire away . 
 directed by curtis hanson . screenplay by steve kloves , based on the novel by michael chabon . starring michael douglas , tobey maguire , robert downey jr . running time : 114 minutes . rated aa . reviewed on march 19th , 2000 . a quiet , understated character piece , " wonder boys " is the sort of movie which , when recalled afterward , seems more like a dream than something actually experienced . slow-moving but never plodding , funny and original without being absurd , it is a pleasurable journey through one man's personal struggles . grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a university of pittsburgh english professor who wrote a critically-acclaimed novel seven years ago and hasn't published anything since . most people think tripp is washed up , but the truth is that his new novel just isn't finished yet ; it is now two thousand single-spaced pages long and counting . tripp , whose wife has just left him , is having an affair with the university chancellor , sara gaskell ( frances mcdormand ) . sara's husband walter ( richard thomas ) is the head of the english department and hence grady's boss . tripp's most promising student is james leer ( tobey maguire ) , a dour and eccentric youth held in disdain by most of his classmates . the lone exception is hannah green ( katie holmes ) , who is also boarding with grady and is clearly interested in taking their relationship beyond the academic . the movie takes place during wordfest , a weekend-long writers' convention . the gaskells host a party to kick off wordfest , during which sara reveals to grady that she is pregnant . going outside for a draw , tripp ( aptly named , given that he spends most of the movie under the influence of drugs , both prescription and otherwise ) encounters james , standing in the backyard with a gun he insists is just a fake . the two sneak upstairs to have a look at walter's collection of memorabilia . when grady is attacked by the gaskells' dog , james shoots it dead . at a loss , tripp ends up lugging the canine corpse around in his trunk until he can figure out what to do about it . all this is just set-up for a sometimes harrowing , always amusing odyssey through the streets of pittsburgh and the problems which plague grady's life . he finds himself having to deal not just with the end of his marriage and the complication of his affair , not just with the dead dog and a stolen piece of walter's collection , not just with editor terry crabtree ( robert downey jr ) whose own job is riding on the publication of tripp's new novel , but with the enigma that is james leer . james isn't just a writer ; the entirety of his behavior is one big creative process ( at one point , intoxicated , he begins narrating out loud ) and it is impossible to take anything he says or does at face value : the fake-gun-that-isn't is just the tip of the iceberg of james' fantasies and deceptions . " wonder boys " is a smart movie that understands its characters and takes the time to develop and explore them fully . written by steve kloves from the novel by michael chabon , it is populated by believable individuals who make believable choices , not ones dictated by stereotypical hollywood expectations . for example , both terry and james are clearly not strictly heterosexual , but when they finally do end up in bed together , it is dealt with almost offhandedly . the event is just a natural development of both characters , and the script does not grind to a halt to exploit it . nothing in " wonder boys " feels staged or melodramatic ; realism seethes from its characters , their relationships with each other , and the decisions they make . but perhaps this is all to be expected . " wonder boys " is a movie all about making choices and the consequences of avoiding them , and a film with such a theme lives and dies on the conviction of its characters . grady has spent the past half-decade evading decisions , and it has cost him his marriage . here , then , is the story of how he comes to rise above his personal apathy and seize control of his life . nowhere is this theme of making choices more clearly illustrated than with grady's epic novel . even hannah , grady's potential new love interest , finds it impossible to finish , but not because it is poorly written . on the other hand , hannah thinks it is beautiful , but she tells grady , " you didn't make any choices " : grady has not found the will to leave anything out of the text , and as a result it has ballooned to mammoth proportions . the manuscript's final fate depicts another important fact about decisions : that sometimes they're made for you , not by you . the movie's dialogue is sparkling throughout , and there are plenty of laughs , many of them derived from the film's frank view of reality . surprisingly for a movie which muses on so deep a theme , " wonder boys " has many of the elements of a screwball comedy , complete with mistaken identities and misplaced valuables . but the screwball elements are always in service to the overall plot , complementing it rather than fragmenting the film . as a result , " wonder boys " is appealing and enjoyable on a number of different levels . the acting is uniformly excellent . douglas finds just the right note as the harried grady , portraying him as confused and aimless without making him seem weak . maguire , always a quiet , reserved actor , is a perfect fit as james -- he is quirky , inspired and fragile , all at the same time . amongst the supporting cast , richard knox gives a hilarious performance as a man who claims to be the real owner of grady's battered car . for a movie about choices , " wonder boys " makes all the right ones . it is smart and well-acted , and the top-notch script finds a good balance between drama and comedy . although its sheer placidness may work against it in such a crowded box office , it should not be overlooked . this may be one of the first oscar contenders of the year 2000 . copyright Ã‚Â© 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/wonderboys . html 
 written by : francis ford coppola , adapted from the novel by john grisham starring : matt damon , claire danes , danny devito , jon voight , and danny glover ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . will rudy defeat leo ? will he enjoy being a lawyer ? opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . 'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . 
 okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it . the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them " to do " his wife . well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . and the fun starts their . this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off . it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy . i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace . even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming . if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good . you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place ! 
 labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . the future was much worse than his vision . the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . in their vocabulary , word " arms " is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . 
 release date : march 31 , 1999 starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , hugo weaving , marcus chong directed by : andy wachowski , larry wachowski distributed by : warner brothers mpaa rating : r ( sci-fi violence ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/matrix . htm perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story . unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length . contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy . only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach . the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . 
 by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . grade : b- ,  
 capsule : perversely entertaining hong kong action with the god of gamblers himself , chow yun-fat . mira sorvino ain't bad either , but the main attraction is the movie's glossy look . chow yun-fat commands the screen the way very few actors do , no matter where they're from . see him in the dozens of other movies he's done for the hong kong studios ( and hang yourself if you haven't seen him in john woo's masterpieces the killer and hard-boiled ) . he is one of the few cult-movie figures who lives up to and beyond the hype . in the replacement killers , he strides onscreen as if just coming in from another hk production without losing a beat . hk fan that i am , i held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite some time . the replacement killers was designed to be chow's big u . s . debut vehicle , but it also serves as the debut for director antoine fuqua ( whose only previous directorial job was the " gangster's paradise " video for coolio ) . both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie , which helps to buoy it all up out of the routine and into the realm of the special . the plot is not the main attraction . chow plays a hitman who crumbles when faced with the prospect of having to ice a policeman , and decides to flee the country . to that end , he enlists mira sorvino's character -- a tattooed forgery artist who lives in an apartment that looks like a close cousin to the one j . f . sebastian inhabited in blade runner . then bad guys with tons of firepower come gunning for both of them , and they have to hit the road . fuqua knows his hk action staples . the movie is saturated with highly choreographed violence . the whole movie glows and glitters : shattering glass , guns blazing , false-color shots from * inside * a gun as a round is chambered . sparks shoot as high-tension lines give when bodies fall on them . metal crumples as cars slam into each other , reflecting the moody green-and-yellow lighting in an underground parking garage . sunglasses glint . put simply , if you don't like movies where these things all figure in abundance , stay home . if you do , buy three copies . you'll wear them all out soon enough . chow and sorvino's characters do not like each other very much -- it's hard to like someone who seems to be responsible for getting your place torched -- but they form a mutual respect which is credible on-screen , and work together to get themselves out of trouble . there's also a good supporting role by michael rooker ( remember him from henry : portrait of a serial killer ? ) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the outside , and yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of jurgen prochnow . the replacement killers is all surface , but it's a wonderful surface to look at . good show all around . now let's see chow -- and fuqua -- in something a little more substantial . i * know * chow can handle it . 
 niagara niagara ( r )  ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

 director : Ã‚Â  rob bowman cast : Ã‚Â  david duchovny , gillian anderson , martin landau , blythe danner , armin mueller-stahl , john neville , glenne headly screenplay : Ã‚Â  chris carter , frank spotnitz producers : Ã‚Â  chris carter , daniel sackheim runtime : Ã‚Â  120 min . us distribution : Ã‚Â  20th century fox rated pg-13 : Ã‚Â  some intense violence , gore by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching " the x-files " every sunday night . it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . and i love gillian anderson . the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met . actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . the series is strong for a lot of reasons . it's original ( though it has many ties to " the twilight zone " and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . actually , it's nice to see a risk at all . 
 ironically , what i was most excited about seeing in patch adams is what eventually left me feeling cheated by it in the end . after seeing the trailers , i knew i was going to get robin williams playing that lovably sensitive , extremely funny man , that shows people there's more to life . you know , the guy from dead poets society and good will hunting . i love that guy ; probably because he had truly inspired me before . and things were going so well for the first two-thirds of this movie too . until it was over and i thought to myself , " wait , i think i've seen this movie before . " in the end , my impression of patch adams is that is has some really funny scenes , and you can't help but fall in love with the guy when he's doing all of these great things , a lot of which you have probably seen in the trailers . and he has a lot to teach everyone he comes into contact with in the film . so throughout i'm thinking , " what a great guy ; i wish i was more like him . " which is always a good set-up . but it never follows through . the dramatic conclusion falls flat , and based on a true story or not , the plot points are a bit cliched . patch adams is a comedy , but more appropriately it would be classified as an inspirational film . and the hallmark of the inspirational film is that climactic scene at the end where the inspirational character takes a stand and is met by stiff consequences , but ultimately we realize that he made a difference . you see it in dead poets society in the " oh captain , my captain " scene . in patch adams though , it never comes . though patch does take an emotional stand at the end in a scene that tries to steal the emotion of a film like dead poets society , i don't know that we're convinced that he truly made a difference . he is a great guy , yes , but maybe not great enough .

's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) . where's joblo coming from ? the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 ) 
 dogma -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring linda fiorentino , matt damon , ben affleck , chris rock written and directed by kevin smith linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . it's a wild ride . they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . wings of desire this ain't . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . 
 if there has been a better comedy of errors this year than i'd reccomend it be shown with this delightful french import from the director of la cage aux folles . it could be a laugh all day film festival , because that's exactly what this movie is . what seems like the french " bean " turns out to be an even more hilarious romp . this movie will have you laughing for days after , and i'm glad i'm able to share this review with you . a man is on a train with francois pignon ( villeret ) when he begins to pull out pictures of different things he has built out of matches . guess how many matches it took ? he asks , 364 , 422 ! pierre is charmed , because he's found an idiot for his friend pierre brochant ( lhermitte . ) every wednesday they invite an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening . tonight it's his turn , and before now , he was idiotless . plus , this guy is in a class of his own . pierre cracks his back while playing golf , the doctor tells him not to go to the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop he attempts to go anyway . then his wife christine ( alexandra vandernoot ) decides to leave him for his cruelty for others . he thinks he's gone to the man he stole her from , then decides she's at a local love club . but in order get the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor . the idiot worsens pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back together with his wife . a complex plot is soon laid out in the household . another film from veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas . name one comedy that takes happens in one place , in a foreign language , and that is incredibly funny . one of the best parts about the dinner game ( besides that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film ) is the fact that while it's called the dinner game , there is no dinner or no game at all . the film's comedy owes almost everything to villeret , he's someone you can just look at and laugh . when the film is remade in the us ( with robin williams as the idiot ) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that is featured here . the supporting cast is good , but it's obvious who's in the center of attention . so , go see the dinner game while you can , this funny , original , and interesting french comedy gets  stars . 
 hollywood has a . 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . 
 apt pupil  -a review by bill chambers ( wchamber@netcom . ca ) ( visit my review archive , play some movie trivia , and more ! film freak central http : //www . geocities . com/~billchambers/ ) starring brad renfro , ian mckellan , elias koteas , david schwimmer screenplay by brandon boyce , based on the novella by stephen king directed by bryan singer " no man is an island , " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other things . bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . singer has yet to get keyser sÃƒÂ¶ze out of his system . his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the " right " or the " wrong " choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . 
 the happy bastard's 30-second review happy gilmore as a father ? of course ! that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . he's a hoot . directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . 
 floating life ( southern star - 1997 ) starring annette shun wah , annie yip , anthony wong , edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee , toby chan , toby wong screenplay by eddie ling-ching fong , clara law produced by bridget ikin directed by clara law running time : 95 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . -------------------------------------------------------------floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . the film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . ms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . however , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . 
 ( miramax - 1996 ) starring william baldwin , angela jones , bruce ramsay , mel gorham , lois chiles , daisy fuentes , barry corbin screenplay by john maass & reb braddock produced by john maass and raul puig directed by reb braddock running time : 94 minutes curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . to be specific , let me give you an example . do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . one particularly striking m . o . on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . no points for guessing what they do . her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . it's a great performance . reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . 
 for just a couple of years now , a certain film director has been doing for action films what marisa tomei did earlier this year for the " love interest " character in film--breathing life into it . if you've not guessed by now , the man i'm talking about is none other than john woo . the only problem is that mr . woo has been doing his thing over in japan , and not in the u . s . of a . woo's the killer had so much word of mouth in japan , that once the film arrived in the states in 1990 it was welcomed with a massive dose of critical praise . well , the wait is finally over . john woo is here , and his american debut goes the distance to prove that he is here to stay . the story is particularly simple : a vietnam vet is murdered by a group of trigger-happy hunters--partial to that race of human beings--and the man's daughter goes looking for him . it seems he was homeless , and to get the proper tour of her father's homeland , the daughter enlists the help of a down-and-out sailor named chance beaudreaux ( played by van damme ) . chance needs two-hundred bucks to ship out of new orleans , and figures that by taking this young and innocent woman up on her offer , he can get what he needs . to convince her that he's the man for the job , chance fights away some homeless thugs looking to rip natalie ( the daughter , played by yancy butler ) off of a few hundred dollars , using his fists and feet to crush bones like nothing you've ever seen in a van damme movie before . natalie is definitely convinced . she and chance soon discover that her father was murdered , and this leads them to cross paths with the leader of the afore-mentioned group ( played by lance henriksen ) . * and * we get another murder-of-a-homeless scene . the vet who's killed this time is someone chance knew as a friend , and--well , you can probably figure out the rest . the story * is * simple at heart , but it isn't really the story that's important here--it's the story * telling * . this is a dynamite action film . director john woo uses techniques--like slow-mo , quick-cut , and freeze frame--that other directors have either taken for granted or have been too afraid to use , and creates an entirely new kind of action movie that most american audiences have never seen before . it's exciting stuff , and it has a truly explosive impact to it ( especially in the climax , at an empty warehouse in the bayous ) . the characterizations * do * leave much to be desired--van damme has one grimacing expression plastered on his mug at all times ( does this guy * ever * smile . . . ? ) , and yancy butler doesn't have much to do here--but , again , these things are nothing more than serviceable to john woo's unique directorial style . he's a master at this kind of movie making . if you see hard target , but still want more woo , check out some of his earlier japanese work ( like the killer and hard boiled ) . these movies all have one thing in common : a superior artist at work . i can compare woo with quentin tarantino in that the two are fresh forces in hollywood who do not need or want to concede with any hollywood standards . target's ear-slicing scene had to be trimmed in order for the film to attain an r-rating . and perhaps that's saying something , too . woo has a little to learn about the united states as far as movies are concerned , and the mpaa and censorship . but it's far from too late , and if woo keeps up the good work he might even be able to break down the mpaa's standards on violence in the movies . 
 starring warren beatty , halle berry and oliver platt directed by warren beatty running time : 1 hour 40 minutes . warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) it's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . they're not cringe inducing , at least . the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . bulworth , then , is well worth watching . 
 starring denzel washington , john hannah , live schreiber , deborah kara unger , viscellous reon shannon , dan hedaya , harris yulin , david paymer , clancy brown , and rod steiger . directed by norman jewison written by armayan bernstein and dan gordon denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history . he is that amazing . the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids . " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in " shawshank redemption " ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 
 field of dreams almost defies description . although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : " if you build it , he will come . " then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . " if you build it , he will come . " and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates . and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to " ease his pain . " ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas . in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical . ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago " black sox " scandal . and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy . in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics . 
 drew barrymore has had a very good year . first , she did the wedding singer with adam sandler , and then she carried her own movie , ever after . both were huge winners at the box office . now she brings us home fries , a romantic comedy costarring catherine o'hara and luke wilson . luke wilson isn't the biggest name in hollywood or anything , but he is still a good actor . he and barrymore are dating in real life , after meeting on the set of this cute movie . barrymore stars as sally , a worker at a restaurant called burger matic . she is pregnant from the affair she had with a man named henry . henry's son , dorian ( luke wilson ) , and his other son , angus ( jake busey ) , accidentally kill their father by giving him a heart attack . their mother put them up to this because he had an affair with another woman . on the radio in the helicopter , they hear fast food workers on interference and figure that they know . so , dorian gets a job at burger matic , the same place where sally works , the woman who had an affair with his father . ok , right now , you are probably very lost , but so was i . as the movie goes on , dorian and sally fall in love , not knowing that sally is also in love with dorian's father . when dorian's mother ( catherine o'hara ) commands angus and dorian to kill sally , ( she finds out from pictures who the woman is ) dorian must stop them before the love of his life is killed . home fries has a very weird and original plot , not like any other movie i have ever seen . that really boosts a movie to a high level . drew barrymore gives an outstanding performance , her best since scream . this movie should boost luke wilson to a star level . catherine o'hara gives a very fake performance that was hard to believe . jake busey was very annoying and i wanted him to go away . shelley duvall did great , and you really believed how her character was feeling . home fries was also suspenseful in it's own way . i wanted certain things to happen and i couldn't tell if they were going to or not . there were a lot of laughs in home fries , but not crack up funny ones . home fries is a cute , small movie , which should make some pretty good money at the box office , but it wont be a blockbuster . it should keep some people just entertained . it is a very simple movie , nothing really complex about it ( except the plot ) . home fries was a really nice movie to watch on thanksgiving , and i enjoyed it a lot . 
 starring : gwyneth paltrow , john hannah , john lynch , jeanne tripplehorningredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition sliding doors is a love 'what if' story . the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . this leads to a life where helen moves out . helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . in story two , helen experiences a different fate . she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! " when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . there are minor inconveniences . since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ? 
 watching crash , the recurring thought that popped into my mind was `damn , i wonder how these people afford auto insurance . ' i mean , here we have a movie about people screwing like rabbits while at the same time crashing cars left and right . and , although crash's really made of a lot tougher stuff than the two of those , they constitute such a large amount of the plot and curious draw of this safe haven of sadomasochism that the producers used the quote `Ã¢â‚¬Â¦sex and car crashes' ( ironically , from a review that blasts the film ) to advertise their celluloid psychosexual psychosis . leave it to me to be thinking of auto insurance rates , when a sexy actresses like deborah kara unger is going at it onscreen . crash is the story of james ballard ( james spader , picking his most interesting ( and perverse ) role since sex , lies , and videotape ) ) , a man who is living in a marriage with a primal curse : his wife , catherine ( deborah kara unger ) , cannot reach orgasm . she loves sex Ã¢â‚¬â€œ her habits are downright nymphomaniacle and the marriage is open-ended Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but nothing she can do can make her reach orgasm . her husband makes this both his personal quest and problemÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the two wonder constantly about each other's sexual partners , go at it at least twice a day , and often have sex at the office . yet nothing's quite doing it for cathy . she's just not getting her big o . one day , while driving home from working on a car crash safety commercial , ballard has a head-on-collision with dr . helen remmington ( holly hunter ) . remmington's husband dies , flying through the windshield , and the last thing ballard witnesses before he passes out is remmington ripping open her shirt and proceeding to begin enjoying herself in the car . 
 every ant has his day . at least , that's what woody allen would have you think , in this twisted animated version of annie hall meets brazil . starting with a moody grass-scape of what turns out to be a quiet corner of central park , voiced-over by allen's `z' , a hapless worker ant who feels the weight of the colony--so to speak--on his back , antz tracks a lot like any allen flick . in fact , if it wasn't for all the forumla-driven bad guys , perilous situations , and narrow escapes , antz would be * exactly * like any other allen film . but this is animation , and that means kid-pleasing effects must plaster the screen . sadly , this hurts the story to the point where antz will quickly get lost in the shuffle of animated films coming out over the next year , despite its unique touches . to make matters worse , some of the more gruesome scenes , including an ant-termite battle that would leave private ryan wetting himself , are decidedly not for children . don't get me wrong , i thoroughly enjoyed the movie . and if the humdrum trailer for a bug's life is any indication , antz is going to be the best we'll see out of computer animation for awhile , at least until toy story 2 . but , to paraphrase z himself , a boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-changes-underlying-social-structure movie . . . just isn't that original . even if it is about ants . more story , less silly antics . maybe then i'll be inclined to put down my can of raid . . . . 
 directed by irwin winkler . cast : val kilmer , mira sorvino , kelly mcgillis , nathan lane , steven weber , bruce davison . 1999 - 128 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity and sexual situations ) . reviewed january 22 , 1999 . like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . on the basis of the overall story , " at first sight " is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , " awakenings . " what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . however , what helps " at first sight " rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer " you've got mail " immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual " love scenes , " and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the " big city . " the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . val kilmer , usually cast in the " macho " type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , " mighty aphrodite , " for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's " mimic , " 1998's " the replacement killers " ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with " at first sight " that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the " bad , " one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . the one misstep of " at first sight " is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . in " awakenings , " the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , " at first sight " comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . 
 shrek ( 2001 ) mike myers , eddie murphy , cameron diaz , john lithgow , vincent cassel . screenplay by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , roger s . h . schulman , based on the book by william steig . directed by andrew adamson , vicky jenson . 89 minutes . rated pg , 4 stars ( out of five stars ) review by ed johnson-ott , nuvo newsweekly www . nuvo . net archive reviews at http : //reviews . imdb . com/reviewsby ? edward + johnson-ott to receive reviews by e-mail at no charge , send subscription requests to ejohnsonott@prodigy . net or e-mail ejohnsonott-subscribe@onelist . com with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . all in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . but first the basics . based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way . all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! " ) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . the movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that'll do , donkey . that'll do " ) to " the graduate . " but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like " it's a small world . " which brings me to disturbing point number one . i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! put the past behind you ! there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . beyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . adding short jokes is simply mean . still , " shrek " is a rollicking good time . the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . to trot out a clichÃƒÂ© , " shrek " is fun for all ages . parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . 
 " oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! " mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . " didn't i sound just like a mother ? " " you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly . " i know , but i still can't believe it . i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? " marty , you see , is a grown-up twin . although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb . the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . in this storm are two sane individuals . the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication . as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night . " we all have our secrets , " jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . this is a house filled with them . ( when lesly calls it the family's " home " to mrs . pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their " house . " ) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , " made for each other , " the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship . they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . director mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . " were you poor ? " jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . " did you eat pies ? chicken pot pies ? " " pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , " lesly replies with her usual sincerity . " a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , " jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . " are we entertaining royalty ? " with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . 
 no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! i can't stand this anymore ! ' . there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! event horizon is highly recommendedÃƒÂ ÃƒÂ but at your own risk ! it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . 
 capsule : jackie chan teams up with his old buddy sammo hung to give us another zero-calorie fight-fest . gloriously foolish fun . my wife had this to say about mr . nice guy : " as entertainment , it's great . as a movie , it sucks . " i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought , the acting was hopeless , the script a throwaway . but it showcased jackie chan's raucous physical comedy -- " martial arts " is the wrong word for it -- and was therefore more than worth it . it isn't the all-out roar of joy that rumble in the bronx and especially supercop were , but it's still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda , and is all the better for it -- even if he's in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist who's just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence , and there's a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks , henchmen , cigar-smoking baddies , and cops . that's about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures , like his girlfriend ( miki lee ) and his female assistant , who have a howlingly funny scene that , due to language barriers , cannot be repeated here . some things you gotta see to believe . jackie's stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it : it's like play , or maybe a kind of dance . one scene has jackie getting into a fight in traffic -- on top of a flood of pepsi cans . another scene involves an unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and corridors . hung ( who directed ) plays it like an homage to the road runner and wile e . coyote cartoons . ( hung also films things a little more loosely and fluidly than staney tong did : we get a lot of steadicam work , lots of things going on in different sectors of the screen . ) another , even more mind-boggling scene , involves jackie being forced to fight with henchmen holding his limbs back with bungee cords . ( yes , he manages to get the upper hand with that one as well . don't ask how . ) the final scene gives us the grand guignol ( sans blood ) ending that a movie like this deserves . here's a hint : in the first five minutes , we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time , jackie was driving . 
 alien resurrection ( r )  ) 1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 
 for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . 
 from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go hoser ! ) director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " . 
 starring tom hanks , david morse , michael duncan , doug hutchinson , james cromwell , bonnie hunt , patricia clarkson , barry pepper , michael jeter , sam rockwell , graham greene , jeffrey demunn , dabbs greer , eve brent , harry dean stanton and gary sinise . it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . his pain creates pain for the viewer . however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . " the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . the speed in " the green mile " is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

" the faculty , " the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's " desperado " and 1996's " from dusk till dawn " ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's " scream " and 1997's " scream 2 " ) , is being called a cross between " invasion of the body snatchers " and " the breakfast club , " and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . the six characters , as in " the breakfast club , " can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . " the faculty " is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original " scream , " and rodriguez , whose " from dusk till dawn " is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . the plotline of " the faculty , " involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from " invasion of the body snatchers , " to " the puppet masters , " to " invaders from mars , " so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . the performances in " the faculty " were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( " t2 : judgement day " ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the " queen " alien , many of the faculty members disappear . it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , " the faculty " is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . - copyright 1998 by dustin putman dustin putman's film reviews  
 starring kirk douglas , william bendix , lee grantkirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking . " detective story " features one of kirk douglas's finest performances . he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in . the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . secrets i would not dream of giving away . with a name like " detective story " , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of " nypd blue " , but it doesn't quite work out that way . however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . the performances all around are fantastic . douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time . we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . which brings me back to douglas . he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father . how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these days : he's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . 
 easily the most anticipated , most delayed film release of 1997 , james cameron's $220 million " titanic " steams into theaters with a slew of questions to answer , most notably was it worth the wait , the hype , and all that money ? well . " titanic " is big , that's for sure . the size and scope of the production are evidenced by a massive , detailed replica of the white star liner , impressive visual effects , countless extras , and a love story transcending the atlantic ocean itself . that , plus the fact that the storyline is played out over three and a quarter hours , and we're talking epic proportions here . " titanic , " alas , doesn't quite live up to its promise or its much-ballyhooed pricetag . but it's an entertainment on a grand scale nonetheless . water-bound dramas are rarely without their production problems . cameron's own " the abyss " had its fair share , and those dogging " waterworld " ( prior to " titanic , " the most expensive movie in hollywood history ) are legendary . on " titanic , " it's clear that cameron the get-it-right-and-budget-be-damned director fairs far better than cameron the sounds-about-right screenwriter . while the ship sinks convincingly and spectacularly enough , leads leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet get saddled with lots of cornball situations and dialogue . cameron's trump card was to make " titanic " first and foremost a love story . however , his straightforward approach to that fateful night on april 15th , 1912 lends itself better to his visual overtures than his romantic undertones . dicaprio plays jack dawson , a freewheeling , penniless ( are there any other kind ? ) artist from steerage who's smitten by winslet's rose dewitt bukater , a stifled society damsel from the upper decks . cameron paints the haves and the have-nots a little too black and white--the rich are all stuffy , boring snots while the poor are the only ones who really know how to have fun--but on the darker side , billy zane is particularly good as rose's suave , callous fiancÃƒÂ© cal hockley . of the innumerable versions of this ocean-going tragedy , this one might be the first to imply that the titanic hit the iceberg because its lookouts were distracted by a couple making out on deck . however , even at its epic length , " titanic " is never boring . time skips by quickly , and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy , including frances fisher ( as rose's disapproving mother ruth ) and bernard hill , in an underwritten role as the ship's ineffectual captain . perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film occurs during its present-day setup , when a rugged salvage expert ( played by bill " we're toast , man ! " paxton ) has one of his staff explain , via a fascinating computer animation , how the ship went down in the icy waters of the north atlantic , sending 1 , 500 of its 2 , 200 passengers and crew to their deaths . all this , of course , is represented in larger-than-life cameron-a-rama later in the film , when the tragedy of 1912 is stunningly recreated . at this point in " titanic , " dicaprio and winslet take a back seat to the spectacle and , like the rest of us , hang on for dear life . 
 the australian documentary the diplomat gives a nearly complete overview of the situation in east timor up to its august 1999 elections . it starts with the historical background of this small island's tribulations : since the 16th century until 1975 , the island was a portuguese colony . then , with the end of the portuguese revolution , east timor declared its independence and was immediately invaded by indonesia , its giant neighbor . the focus of the film is josÃƒÂ© ramos horta , a political activist who represents the eastern timorese resistance historic leader , xanana gusmao , who was imprisoned in indonesia for a 20-year sentence . horta is a 1996 nobel prize winner who has been fighting for the independence of this little-known island for 24 years . the most compelling aspect of the film is its ability to convey how the tragic events of east timor and its desperate struggle for independence have been largely ignored by the world . since east timor has no army to support its claims for autonomy , horta says it must have been an act of god that his people had survived . horta's life is that of a peripatetic fighter who is exiled from the country the independence of which is his life mission . the challenge of horta's mission is accentuated by the fact that there is no unity among the leaders of east timor ; some of them are satisfied by living in a country annexed to its oppressors , others are adamant to fight for complete independence till the end . the film follows horta , almost always dog-tired , from one conference on the east timorese crisis to another and intersperses horta's diplomatic career with footage of hot events happening in east timor : president suharto resigns , habibie takes his place , nothing changes . indonesia itself has enough to worry about and when its economic crisis reaches the bottom of the barrel , indonesian foreign minister ali alatas is sent to deliver to the world promises of security and protection for east timor . while horta's mother , natalina , recollects how indonesian militia attacked her residence and took the lives of her children , the actual footage testifies the acts of barbaric genocide that took place on the island . the film hits all the appropriate strings by conveying how murder , torture , rape , all kinds of physical , sexual , and psychological violations have been the daily life of the people of east timor . it clearly exemplifies the frightening hypocrisy of the indonesian government which declares the crisis stable while more and more people are being brutally executed . unfortunately , up until the depiction of the 1999 democratic election in east timor , the film more or less plods along . it is only then that the film picks up the pace by showing that just four hours after the official announcement , the defeated militia gangs start to set east timor on fire . there is a moment of almost sublime irony when president bill clinton visits indonesia with the intention to stop the genocide and bring un peacekeeping forces to the country . he is greeted with a military ceremony that , in my opinion , signifies the irreconcilable difference between the east and the west . ironically , the portrait of josÃƒÂ© ramos horta , an indefatigable fighter who broke the silence about east timor in the ( disinterested ) western press , doesn't come out as memorable or inspiring . unquestionably , the film is very effective and involving due to its subject matter , without a mawkish triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed . but what should have been a celebration of human tenacity comes out as an intelligent film , though with a somewhat insipid portrayal of its hero . 
 cast : dennis quaid , james caviezel , shawn doyle , elizabeth mitchell , andre braugher , noah emmerich written by : toby emmerich directed by : gregory hoblit running time : 117 minutes when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . such was the case with frequency . every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . it looked awful . it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . it looked like a flop . well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . frequency boasts a compelling story line . an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . including john's mother . this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ? yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense . most films are like that . don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .

 cast : pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , chris tucker director : quentin tarantino producer : lawrence bender screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the book rum punch by elmore leonard cinematography : guillermo navarro u . s . distributor : miramax films it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlighted as an " actor " with several decidedly unmemorable performances . now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . jackie brown's lone " innovation " is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn't exactly an original technique Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's " banyon " ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds . soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . 
 with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , " wow . . . " like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien " phantoms . " whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a " zeus cannon , " dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a " wave " using eight collected " spirits " to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't . it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . why do these aliens feed on souls ? if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? what is so special about the " spirits " that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking . for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you're more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . there's no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . 
 eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . 
 there's good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that's chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have . you ain't never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( " heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . " ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is " be a man , " the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , " be a man " accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george " mr . sulu " takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , " alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ? " " well , there's mr . myagi . . . " " good . " " and mr . sulu . " " perfect . we've got ourselves a movie now .

 " high fidelity " ( 2000 )  directed by stephen frears written by d . v . devincentis , steve pink , john cusack , and scott michael rosenberg starring john cusack , iben hjejle , jack black , todd louiso , lisa bonet , catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor , joan cusack , natasha gregson wagner , and tim robbins just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . but these aren't any girlfriendsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . the plot in three words is : women and music . the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . 
 after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . remember , the robot ? it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . " the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . " upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . " this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . " mate with her ! " spencer exclaims . " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . " the show has many funny twists . in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . oh , and eating is pretty funny too . spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * . when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully . 
 go -a review by bill chambers ( go@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring sarah polley , desmond askew , jay mohr , scott wolf screenplay by john august directed by doug liman go's is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive . a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier . in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go . but i digress . go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) . i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

 one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . mother-in-law jokes prevail . furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . this is what binds the movie together . joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . 
 the relaxed dude rides a roller coasterthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " . the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " . lebowski's passion is bowling . when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . even worse , they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . the kidnappers are impossibly inept . the dude and his cronies are even worse . every plan goes awry . you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " . the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement . the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket . he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes . a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .

  jackie brown ( miramax - 1997 ) starring pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , michael bowen , chris tucker screenplay by quentin tarantino , based on the novel rum punch by elmore leonard produced by lawrence bender directed by quentin tarantino running time : 155 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( " $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn " ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel " rum punch " ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . 
 a miramax pictures release . starring robin williams , matt damon , ben affleck , stellan skarsgard , minnie driver , casey affleck , cole hauser , george plimpton . script by ben affleck and matt damon . produced by lawrence bender . directed by gus van sant . running time : 125 mins . rated r . " good will hunting " is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , " prodigy child " film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick . unusually directed by gus van sant , " good will hunting " overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent . the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams . in a nutshell , that's it . the core of the " good will hunting " is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by " chasing amy's " ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer . but it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( " awakenings " was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death . damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein . his rich , complex character is the pulp of " good will hunting . " everything else pales in comparison . " good will hunting " exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike " little man tate " or " phenomenon " , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned . 
 one of the best-ever names for a holiday special ( sure as hell beats frosty returns ) hits home video a year after its tv premiere , in this animated production from simpsons creator matt groening . based on a book by j . otto seibold and vivian walsh , olive's a hip dash of christmas humor and fun amidst specials that have just made little kids cry all these years . see , olive's not really a reindeer - she's a dog . a strange dog . voiced by drew barrymore , she speaks english to her owner tim ( jay mohr ) , doesn't dig for bones , and won't chase cars . while listening to the radio on christmas eve , she hears that santa may cancel his delivery , as blitzen is injured . he announces ( in a 90's soundbite ) , that he'll just have to rely on " all of the other reindeer . " olive is so caught up in the holidays , she thinks santa is talking about her . even her pet flea can't believe it . once it's set that she's really a lonely misfit -- a holiday story staple -- she's off to the north pole with a shifty penguin named martini ( the matrix's joe pantoliano ) . they catch a " mauvehound bus " driven by a weirdo named richard stands ( snl's tim meadows ) , who once thought the pledge of allegiance was for him ( say it out loud ) . but it's not just an easy bus trip that'll get olive to santaland . our villain is a demented mailman ( simpsons veteran dan castellaneta ) who just goes postal during the holiday season due to the weight of the all his deliveries . he'd love for santa's cancellation to hold up , so he's on his own quest to stop olive and company . as with any good simpsons episode , groening's writer -- simpsons and david letterman staffer steve young -- fills the story and landscape with bad puns and inside visuals that welcome the adults into the action just as much as the kids . the laughs don't have the stinging irony of the simpsons , but they are certainly playful enough to hold most viewers' interest . as is the animation , a freaky mix of multi-dimensional backgrounds and flat characters . it looks like a strange combination of a kid's video game and a set of colorforms , giving it a splashy , original look . there are a few musical numbers that whiz by , most notably the postman's lament about delivering the mail ( the best lyrics in the feature ) , and a ditty headed by rem's michael stipe , singing as schnitzel the reindeer . just a few minutes into olive , i wondered why drew barrymore was voicing our hero . she's not really a voice actor , and doesn't sound too expressive . then i read that she and partner nancy juvonen are also executive producers on this special . drew may want to audition a few others next time . but , like most of olive , drew's voice grew on me . this is a special that's hard not to enjoy , and it thankfully avoids any sappy finale . it may not enter the pantheon of holiday classics , but it's just too damn cute not to watch once a year . especially when olive wags that little tail . that's great . 
 " a dream of dark and troubling things . " -- david lynchthere are those who say " eraserhead " makes little sense , and then there are those who say that " eraserhead " isn't supposed to make sense . i'm with the second camp : if " eraserhead " made any sense at all , it wouldn't be nearly as interesting . " eraserhead " is allegedly a horror movie , but i put it instead on that small shelf of films that abandon all pretense at being entertainment and just give you an experience : " begotten " , " the reflecting skin " and alejandro jodorowsky's head-trips ( " el topo " , " the magic mountain " ) are close cousins in spirit to this film . there is a story , sort of . henry spencer ( lynch regular john nance ) is a nerdish , creepy-looking man living in a squalid little apartment . he's accidentally impregnated his girlfriend , and the baby turns out to be a vile little creature that looks something like e . t . after thalidomide . the news about the pregnancy , by the way , comes out during a dinner where the main course consists of chickens the size of one's fist that still move and spurt blood when sliced into . there's also a strangely deformed woman who seems to live in henry's radiator . . . and by this point you're either shaking your head in dismay or wondering where to find the movie . i guess that means i've done my job . " eraserhead " needs to be seen on the big screen to work properly . on tv , the black-on-black photography -- this is the single darkest movie ever made , and i don't just mean in terms of subject matter ! -- reproduces very poorly . also , on tv , the black and white images don't saturate the senses the way they do in a theater . there's also the most creative use of sound in almost any movie i've ever seen : not a single scene in the film is silent . there's always something rumbling , hissing , clattering , bubbling , booming away in either the background or the next room over , and it has the same effect on the audience's nerves as a dentist's drill . before david lynch started screwing with america's mind via " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " , he spent five years , on and off , making " eraserhead " . it shows . there is a level of obsessive care in every frame of this film that many movies costing hundreds of times more don't show at all . people may wonder : if this thing's so weird and so repulsive , why did i give it three and a half stars ? because it dares to be different and succeeds . i don't automatically reward every movie that's " experimental " with a positive review , but they sure deserve the benefit of the doubt . -----------== posted via deja news , the discussion network ==---------- http : //www . dejanews . com/ search , read , discuss , or start your own 
 what starts out as a monotonous talking-head musical history lecture turns into a rich land of louisiana discovery , as robert mugge adventures into the various landscapes of that colorful state . three different sections of louisiana are documented along the journey , northern , southern , and southwestern louisiana , separated by maps and cutesy subtitles . the latter two are the best installments , in that they allow the charismatic performers direct camera time without the interference of a boring onscreen interviewer . each county has a different character , style , instruments , and sound , all distinct in their origins , as local experts tell us , and mugge respectfully picks up these discerning traits . where one town declares that race isn't an issue , the other shows how racial tensions actually aided in black and white musicians inspiring one another . southern louisiana has a strong cajun/creole base , while northern louisiana leans towards guitar and a cappella singing . as a whole , this documentary is well layered with performance and testimony but could easily have been shorter and made the same impact on an audience . in the first section especially , numerous concert performances run superfluously through an entire song , with the camera panning to and fro , looking for something to do . every person put in front of the camera is introduced , but only half the multitude leave much of a mark . the director of the louisiana folk festival expounds on the glories of louisiana's past for an interminable period of time , but most of what he says goes in what ear and out the other . on the other hand , there's a remarkably short section devoted to a 28-year disc jockey veteran , sister pearlee tolliver . she spends her two hours on the radio exclaiming commercials in a gospel voice , with a couple of records thrown in , and she amuses too much to forget . as standard documentaries go , the expected talking heads are mixed in with live concert performances . but most endearing are the discussions with actual performers about their influences and playing style , and reminiscences about their colleagues . these interviews , juxtaposed with the local connoisseurs , provide a solid foundation for the musically ignorant and die hard fan . one of the best portraits is that of kermit ruffins , a local favorite in southwestern louisiana . he takes the historical roots of jazz and blues and mixes them with his own modern experiences growing up in the streets . popularity hasn't blown his ego either , as once in a while he barbeques for his audience out of the back of his truck . other details compliment this musical voyage . the first record store in louisiana , floyd's , is renowned for shipping impossible-to-find music all over the world . the original owner still runs it and helps to promote new talent such as rosie ledet . rosie was a housewife who taught herself how to play the accordion and she now sings and tours with her husband's band . at once mousy and humble , this lady has gone on to break ground for female artists in the zydeco field . before walking into to this film , one might think that all of louisiana could be clumped into a simple stereotype . it takes a while to be interested in the material , but once the filmmaker moves onto southern louisiana , it's hard to look away from the screen . 
 a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb . men in black is a four-star three-star film . ( hope you could follow that one ) men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " . nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof . naturally nobody believes his story . . . nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib . edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . james edwards no longer exists . meet agent jay . agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties . eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does . barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely . it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed . a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me ! 
 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . 
 on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . he is insane , apparently . the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax . but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . bad cutting puts the timing way out . in other words , he's almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . proof that he can do it , if he tries . . . 
 starring : ashley judd , tommy lee jones , annabeth gish , bruce greenwood , michael gaston . rated r for violence , language and some sexuality . underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . he is a man who has had his share of bad things . while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . whatever happens the film was excellent to me . i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . reviewed by brandon herring october 13 , 1999 . brandon herring movie review heaven ( http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html 
 as south park : bigger , longer and uncut opens , the citizens of the famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune . the birds are chirping , the sun is shining , and the friendly inhabitants are smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune . enter the foursome of cartman , kyle , stan and kenny , the infamous group of elementary school children that the tv show is based upon . they see an ad bearing the names of their favorite fart-lighting duo of terrance and phillip , who are appearing in their very first feature length movie ( a canadian production ) . and so they venture forth to the local cineplex , where they are shamefully turned down from seeing this graphic , r-rated feature . after bribing a homeless man to accompany them as their `parental guardian' , the boys make it in to watch the movie , unaware that the profane language they learn will soon thereafter destroy their quiet and peaceful town . south park is a tv show that grew immensely popular on comedy central . mostly , of course , with the less demanding younger viewers , who found the idea of swearing and offensive cardboard children to be just their cup of tea . now that co-creators trey parker and matt stone are free of their television rating confines , they have pushed the envelope as far as it can possibly go . the south park movie is more raunchy , vulgar and repeatedly crude than anything you have probably ever seen . the obscenities flow so consistently that unwilling viewers may be scarred for life , left to babble on in profane gibberish . the reason the film exists is that parker and stone can take revenge on the mpaa ( that's the motion picture association of america ) , with whom they've experienced a complicated past . but , they won't stop there . how many groups , minorities and individuals does the south park movie stab in the back ? with the exception of the mpaa , there is ( ahem * ) black people , jewish people , gay people , anne murray , celine dion , jar jar binks , the baldwin brothers , saddam hussein , brian boitano , bill gates , barbara streisand , and most blatantly of all : canada ! parker and stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we canadians , from speech patterns to flag-wearing and beyond . it would be advisable for anyone who is easily offended to avoid this film , at all costs . but back to the plot . after the south park children begin to utter shocking four-letter words as part of their regular vocabulary , the mothers take action . forming mac ( mothers against canada ) , they take their case to president clinton , forcing him to proclaim war on the neighboring country for polluting the american children's minds with their obscene movie productions . terrance and phillip are thereby scheduled to be executed , with a pre-celebrity bash including winona ryder and big gay al . the south park children decide to band together , stop the bloodbath , and save the lives of their acting icons before all is lost . let me first say that i laughed . lord help me , i nearly busted a gut during some uproarious musical numbers . yes , in case you didn't know already , the south park movie is basically a feature-length animated musical . the lyrics are often side-splitting and many of the songs have an enjoyable beat , especially the re-enactment of the widely cherished `kyle's mom's a b--ch' , performed with eager enthusiasm by cartman himself . as a sub-plot , kenny sets himself on fire while attempting to light his own fart , and descends to hell . there he meets satan , who is having a heated affair with none other than saddam hussein . for such ( intentionally ) crummy animation , there are some impressive computer-generated visuals down below . unfortunately , this and many other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into disgusting vulgarity . south park : bigger , longer and uncut nearly received an nc-17 from the mpaa , and for good reason ; this film is not for young audiences . while a half-hour episode is nicely filling , the 90-minute movie begins to lose fuel as it nears the conclusion . but some sequences are so hilarious , and some pop culture references so cleverly placed , you just have to appreciate the effort . south park : bigger , longer and uncut breaks every rule in the book , and if you have the courage , you just might find it entertaining . 
 krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 
 tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . that's a shocking 100 times profit ! rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . tbwp is simply smart . filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . simply amazing in that respect , i must say . talk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . you have to see it for yourself . i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! 
 capsule : starts off as a legal thriller , but mutates into something much closer to the heart -- and features gene hackman in a typically excellent performance . some movies lead you wrong , and that's a good thing . the chamber , adapted from the john grishamn novel , starts off as a typical legal-thriller-with-a-twist , but then slowly turns into a different sort of story , about one man trying to find the truth about the past and another man trying to find the truth about himself . the two men are adam hall , a young chicago laywer , and his grandfather , sam cayhall . cayhall is a product of the worst breeds of southern racism , in whose fold he built and detonated several bombs . " i never meant to kill anyone , " he repeats angrily , but bombs are generally not designed to do much else , and three trials and countless appeals later , he is now on death row . hall , his grandson , has decided to take on the eleventh-hour defense . hall and cayhill do not like each other . cayhill has no use for lawyers -- most of the reasons , it seems at first , are blatantly racist , and don't bear repeating here ( even though they are delivered with consummate skill by hackman ) . hall doesn't like the bitter old man , but he smells a great deal is being held away from a lot of people's noses here , and digs . he finds a lot . as the movie unwound , i felt it could have gone one of two ways : either it could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish ( the way the dreadful a time to kill ended up ) , or it could pay closer attention to the people in the story . it takes the second road , and is all the better for it . and be warned : as a result , we don't get a nice , tidy conclusion -- a lot of threads are left dangling , probably deliberately , since the real conclusion of the movie is in the way hackman's character handles his oncoming fate . eventually we see that his racism is not so much a philosophy as a way of warding off terrible grief and hurt , and self-hatred ( as is the case with most virulently racist people , they compensate violently for not having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis ) . hall ( played by chris o'donnell with maturity and grace ) also has a transformation of his own , but a smaller one : sometimes it's not possible to use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong , just to comment on it . he resents his grandfather for using the same tired excuses , but at the same time batters patiently at the man's defenses , knowing that it's only a matter of time before the imminence of the clock will get him to say something true to his heart . he does .

" the tailor of panama " is a different kind of spy movie . despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carrÃ© , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . osnard offers harry a way out . he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . osnard turns in reports about the " silent opposition , " a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . the metropolis , described by one character as " casablanca without heroes " pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . " the tailor of panama " succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . 
 review by scott hunt . visit me at movie hunt http : //netdirect . net/~hunt/index . html cast : chow yun-fat , jodie foster , bai ling director : andy tennant writer : anna leonowens , steve meerson , peter krikes anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . anna function is to help provide that link . the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . it shows a seduction of intelligence . ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 
 scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . . . scream 2 ! 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled " stab " , which has been developed into a major motion picture . as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of " stab " , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown " copycat " sets out to repeat what's been done . . . and finish what hasn't ! of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . i will note , however , that the " whodunit ? " did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . all the actors outdo themselves here . we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . like they say , don't mess with perfection . . . but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ? 
 when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other " martial arts " flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . 
 rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odoen ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by uip on april 7 , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 126 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by stephen soderbergh ; produced by danny devito , michael shamberg , stacey sher . written by susannah grant . photographed by ed lachmann ; edited by anne v . coates . it's astounding , how many of us turn into lawyers when we get wrapped up in cases . i remember the louise woodward affair , for example , when i knew all the evidence from the courtroom pictures on tv , and was able to reel off detailed arguments crushing people who had just looked at her and assumed she was guilty . passion about justice is what makes people consider law careers ; it chills me when i see sell-outs trying to condemn obviously innocent people , or using dishonest tactics to help the guilty . stephen soderbergh's " erin brockovich " is a brilliant story of anger turning into courtroom skills ; a david versus goliath-style exposÃ© in the great tradition of " silkwood " , " a civil action " and " the insider " . at its centre is a woman with no judiciary training or expertise , whose mind was not complicated with red tape or histories of statutes , and whose discoveries and simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the biggest lawsuits in american history . her name , of course , is erin brockovich ( julia roberts ) , and when we meet her in the opening scenes of this film , she's just a struggling single mother who has failed to win a personal injury settlement . soon after , she hustles her way into a filing job at the firm of her solicitor . the boss , ed masry ( albert finney ) , objects , but erin makes her services hard to refuse : " i need a job . don't make me beg . if it doesn't work out , fire me . " when handling the real estate documents of a town in california , erin notices something odd -- they all include medical records . researching this further , she stumbles on the information that the area's water supplier , pacific gas & electric , has been using a dangerous chemical known as 'hexavalent chromium 3' in their pipes . 'chromium 3' can penetrate the body to cause pretty much any illness , including all forms of cancer . what's especially horrific is that pg&e knew about the hazards of their water and misinformed its customers that chromium was good for them . the people took the company's word , even when they all started to get sick , until erin brockovich revealed her findings , and used her common touch to encourage the folks to stand up and take legal action . brockovich is not always a likeable character . at the start of the movie , when no job interviewers will look past her lack of a resumÃ© or qualifications , her feeling of victimisation is preposterous . she seems to think anyone who isn't stuck in the poverty trap must be some sort of snob . and she displays gross arrogance when defending her wardrobe , which is made up of mini-skirts , tight boob tubes and high-heeled boots . " as long as i have one ass instead of two , " she tells masry when he points out that his office has a dress code , " i'll wear what i god damn well please . " but none of these flaws take away from her achievement , which is that she worked hard , taught herself some tough skills , became a great friend and advocate for victims of an abominable crime , and managed to raise a family at the same time . this is one of roberts's most impressive performances , her best since " pretty woman " ( 1990 ) , because she really does look affected by the pressures her character has to cope with . she allows herself to be vulnerable , with a voice that can quiver and stumble . she doesn't always have the answers , and could break down at any minute . there are one or two irritating episodes of grandstanding , where she rattles off snappy , heroic speeches that probably took the screenwriter hours to write ; but that's kind of obligatory , and i'm just glad that such moments don't dominate the film . " erin brockovich " is not necessarily better than the films i previously mentioned , but has advantages over each of them in one way or another . it's more fast-paced and accessible than " silkwood " , angrier about its subject matter than " a civil action " and less sidetracked than " the insider " . i'm starting to love director soderbergh's new visual style , too , which he also used in " out of sight " , and mixes the colour palette and star power of big studio movies with the documentary camera and quiet pacing of realistic independents . sounds distracting . but it's oddly compelling . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic's website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic 
 starring steve martin , eddie murphy , heather graham , christine baranski , jamie kennedy , robert downey jr . , and terrence stamp . the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money . in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger . he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . will bowfinger be able to make his film ? or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . 
 hype ? sheesh , like no other . this side of titanic , good will hunting has enjoyed some of the most baffling , gushing praise of the year . does either film deserve it ? not really . let's look at the facts : you have matt damon as will hunting -- apparently the smartest man on the face of the earth who can also kick anyone's ass over breakfast , and has a history of run-ins with the law . oh no ! affleck is his down-to-earth best bud . driver , the hoity-toity love interest . williams and skarsgÃ¥rd as hunting's mentors , the guys that rescue him from a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer . and it is made abundantly clear that the film is also about the class stuggle in boston . now that i've typed it out , it sounds ridiculous , and the more i think about it , the more it really * is * . the plot and theme of good will hunting hinge upon the idea that it's tough for the smartest man in the world to make the move from crumb-bum to respectable member of society . why ? because ( a ) " just because he has a gift he doesn't have to use it ! " and ( b ) he had a troubled childhood . well , boo hoo ! the more i write , the more it sounds like a topic on " jenny jones " : boy geniuses on the wrong side of the tracks . right . if any believable character had this guy's abilities , this movie would have been much different . . . and probably much shorter , too . i realize i'm ranting here , but the pop psychology of hunting reaches such a high level of annoyance so that when williams tearfully confronts damon with the film's signature line of -- i kid you not -- " it's not your fault , " it just gets silly . and it lost me . the script , written by damon and affleck , is otherwise humorous and keeps you entertained . van sant's direction is inexplicably amateurish and features some lousy voice dubbing . williams is pretty good in his role , and for what it's worth , so is damon , even though the character is ludicrous . all told , the film has plenty of enjoyable moments , but it's just not the deep experience the filmmakers want you to believe it is . and neither was titanic . that ought to guarantee me plenty of hate mail for the next few weeks . fire away . 
 directed by curtis hanson . screenplay by steve kloves , based on the novel by michael chabon . starring michael douglas , tobey maguire , robert downey jr . running time : 114 minutes . rated aa . reviewed on march 19th , 2000 . a quiet , understated character piece , " wonder boys " is the sort of movie which , when recalled afterward , seems more like a dream than something actually experienced . slow-moving but never plodding , funny and original without being absurd , it is a pleasurable journey through one man's personal struggles . grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a university of pittsburgh english professor who wrote a critically-acclaimed novel seven years ago and hasn't published anything since . most people think tripp is washed up , but the truth is that his new novel just isn't finished yet ; it is now two thousand single-spaced pages long and counting . tripp , whose wife has just left him , is having an affair with the university chancellor , sara gaskell ( frances mcdormand ) . sara's husband walter ( richard thomas ) is the head of the english department and hence grady's boss . tripp's most promising student is james leer ( tobey maguire ) , a dour and eccentric youth held in disdain by most of his classmates . the lone exception is hannah green ( katie holmes ) , who is also boarding with grady and is clearly interested in taking their relationship beyond the academic . the movie takes place during wordfest , a weekend-long writers' convention . the gaskells host a party to kick off wordfest , during which sara reveals to grady that she is pregnant . going outside for a draw , tripp ( aptly named , given that he spends most of the movie under the influence of drugs , both prescription and otherwise ) encounters james , standing in the backyard with a gun he insists is just a fake . the two sneak upstairs to have a look at walter's collection of memorabilia . when grady is attacked by the gaskells' dog , james shoots it dead . at a loss , tripp ends up lugging the canine corpse around in his trunk until he can figure out what to do about it . all this is just set-up for a sometimes harrowing , always amusing odyssey through the streets of pittsburgh and the problems which plague grady's life . he finds himself having to deal not just with the end of his marriage and the complication of his affair , not just with the dead dog and a stolen piece of walter's collection , not just with editor terry crabtree ( robert downey jr ) whose own job is riding on the publication of tripp's new novel , but with the enigma that is james leer . james isn't just a writer ; the entirety of his behavior is one big creative process ( at one point , intoxicated , he begins narrating out loud ) and it is impossible to take anything he says or does at face value : the fake-gun-that-isn't is just the tip of the iceberg of james' fantasies and deceptions . " wonder boys " is a smart movie that understands its characters and takes the time to develop and explore them fully . written by steve kloves from the novel by michael chabon , it is populated by believable individuals who make believable choices , not ones dictated by stereotypical hollywood expectations . for example , both terry and james are clearly not strictly heterosexual , but when they finally do end up in bed together , it is dealt with almost offhandedly . the event is just a natural development of both characters , and the script does not grind to a halt to exploit it . nothing in " wonder boys " feels staged or melodramatic ; realism seethes from its characters , their relationships with each other , and the decisions they make . but perhaps this is all to be expected . " wonder boys " is a movie all about making choices and the consequences of avoiding them , and a film with such a theme lives and dies on the conviction of its characters . grady has spent the past half-decade evading decisions , and it has cost him his marriage . here , then , is the story of how he comes to rise above his personal apathy and seize control of his life . nowhere is this theme of making choices more clearly illustrated than with grady's epic novel . even hannah , grady's potential new love interest , finds it impossible to finish , but not because it is poorly written . on the other hand , hannah thinks it is beautiful , but she tells grady , " you didn't make any choices " : grady has not found the will to leave anything out of the text , and as a result it has ballooned to mammoth proportions . the manuscript's final fate depicts another important fact about decisions : that sometimes they're made for you , not by you . the movie's dialogue is sparkling throughout , and there are plenty of laughs , many of them derived from the film's frank view of reality . surprisingly for a movie which muses on so deep a theme , " wonder boys " has many of the elements of a screwball comedy , complete with mistaken identities and misplaced valuables . but the screwball elements are always in service to the overall plot , complementing it rather than fragmenting the film . as a result , " wonder boys " is appealing and enjoyable on a number of different levels . the acting is uniformly excellent . douglas finds just the right note as the harried grady , portraying him as confused and aimless without making him seem weak . maguire , always a quiet , reserved actor , is a perfect fit as james -- he is quirky , inspired and fragile , all at the same time . amongst the supporting cast , richard knox gives a hilarious performance as a man who claims to be the real owner of grady's battered car . for a movie about choices , " wonder boys " makes all the right ones . it is smart and well-acted , and the top-notch script finds a good balance between drama and comedy . although its sheer placidness may work against it in such a crowded box office , it should not be overlooked . this may be one of the first oscar contenders of the year 2000 . copyright Â© 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/wonderboys . html 
 written by : francis ford coppola , adapted from the novel by john grisham starring : matt damon , claire danes , danny devito , jon voight , and danny glover ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . will rudy defeat leo ? will he enjoy being a lawyer ? opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . 'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . 
 okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it . the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them " to do " his wife . well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . and the fun starts their . this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off . it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy . i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace . even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming . if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good . you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place ! 
 labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . the future was much worse than his vision . the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . in their vocabulary , word " arms " is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . 
 release date : march 31 , 1999 starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , hugo weaving , marcus chong directed by : andy wachowski , larry wachowski distributed by : warner brothers mpaa rating : r ( sci-fi violence ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/matrix . htm perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story . unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length . contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy . only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach . the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . 
 by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . grade : b- ,  
 capsule : perversely entertaining hong kong action with the god of gamblers himself , chow yun-fat . mira sorvino ain't bad either , but the main attraction is the movie's glossy look . chow yun-fat commands the screen the way very few actors do , no matter where they're from . see him in the dozens of other movies he's done for the hong kong studios ( and hang yourself if you haven't seen him in john woo's masterpieces the killer and hard-boiled ) . he is one of the few cult-movie figures who lives up to and beyond the hype . in the replacement killers , he strides onscreen as if just coming in from another hk production without losing a beat . hk fan that i am , i held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite some time . the replacement killers was designed to be chow's big u . s . debut vehicle , but it also serves as the debut for director antoine fuqua ( whose only previous directorial job was the " gangster's paradise " video for coolio ) . both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie , which helps to buoy it all up out of the routine and into the realm of the special . the plot is not the main attraction . chow plays a hitman who crumbles when faced with the prospect of having to ice a policeman , and decides to flee the country . to that end , he enlists mira sorvino's character -- a tattooed forgery artist who lives in an apartment that looks like a close cousin to the one j . f . sebastian inhabited in blade runner . then bad guys with tons of firepower come gunning for both of them , and they have to hit the road . fuqua knows his hk action staples . the movie is saturated with highly choreographed violence . the whole movie glows and glitters : shattering glass , guns blazing , false-color shots from * inside * a gun as a round is chambered . sparks shoot as high-tension lines give when bodies fall on them . metal crumples as cars slam into each other , reflecting the moody green-and-yellow lighting in an underground parking garage . sunglasses glint . put simply , if you don't like movies where these things all figure in abundance , stay home . if you do , buy three copies . you'll wear them all out soon enough . chow and sorvino's characters do not like each other very much -- it's hard to like someone who seems to be responsible for getting your place torched -- but they form a mutual respect which is credible on-screen , and work together to get themselves out of trouble . there's also a good supporting role by michael rooker ( remember him from henry : portrait of a serial killer ? ) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the outside , and yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of jurgen prochnow . the replacement killers is all surface , but it's a wonderful surface to look at . good show all around . now let's see chow -- and fuqua -- in something a little more substantial . i * know * chow can handle it . 
 niagara niagara ( r )  ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

 director : Â  rob bowman cast : Â  david duchovny , gillian anderson , martin landau , blythe danner , armin mueller-stahl , john neville , glenne headly screenplay : Â  chris carter , frank spotnitz producers : Â  chris carter , daniel sackheim runtime : Â  120 min . us distribution : Â  20th century fox rated pg-13 : Â  some intense violence , gore by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching " the x-files " every sunday night . it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . and i love gillian anderson . the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met . actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . the series is strong for a lot of reasons . it's original ( though it has many ties to " the twilight zone " and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . actually , it's nice to see a risk at all . 
 ironically , what i was most excited about seeing in patch adams is what eventually left me feeling cheated by it in the end . after seeing the trailers , i knew i was going to get robin williams playing that lovably sensitive , extremely funny man , that shows people there's more to life . you know , the guy from dead poets society and good will hunting . i love that guy ; probably because he had truly inspired me before . and things were going so well for the first two-thirds of this movie too . until it was over and i thought to myself , " wait , i think i've seen this movie before . " in the end , my impression of patch adams is that is has some really funny scenes , and you can't help but fall in love with the guy when he's doing all of these great things , a lot of which you have probably seen in the trailers . and he has a lot to teach everyone he comes into contact with in the film . so throughout i'm thinking , " what a great guy ; i wish i was more like him . " which is always a good set-up . but it never follows through . the dramatic conclusion falls flat , and based on a true story or not , the plot points are a bit cliched . patch adams is a comedy , but more appropriately it would be classified as an inspirational film . and the hallmark of the inspirational film is that climactic scene at the end where the inspirational character takes a stand and is met by stiff consequences , but ultimately we realize that he made a difference . you see it in dead poets society in the " oh captain , my captain " scene . in patch adams though , it never comes . though patch does take an emotional stand at the end in a scene that tries to steal the emotion of a film like dead poets society , i don't know that we're convinced that he truly made a difference . he is a great guy , yes , but maybe not great enough .

's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) . where's joblo coming from ? the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 ) 
 dogma -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring linda fiorentino , matt damon , ben affleck , chris rock written and directed by kevin smith linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . it's a wild ride . they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . wings of desire this ain't . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . 
 if there has been a better comedy of errors this year than i'd reccomend it be shown with this delightful french import from the director of la cage aux folles . it could be a laugh all day film festival , because that's exactly what this movie is . what seems like the french " bean " turns out to be an even more hilarious romp . this movie will have you laughing for days after , and i'm glad i'm able to share this review with you . a man is on a train with francois pignon ( villeret ) when he begins to pull out pictures of different things he has built out of matches . guess how many matches it took ? he asks , 364 , 422 ! pierre is charmed , because he's found an idiot for his friend pierre brochant ( lhermitte . ) every wednesday they invite an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening . tonight it's his turn , and before now , he was idiotless . plus , this guy is in a class of his own . pierre cracks his back while playing golf , the doctor tells him not to go to the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop he attempts to go anyway . then his wife christine ( alexandra vandernoot ) decides to leave him for his cruelty for others . he thinks he's gone to the man he stole her from , then decides she's at a local love club . but in order get the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor . the idiot worsens pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back together with his wife . a complex plot is soon laid out in the household . another film from veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas . name one comedy that takes happens in one place , in a foreign language , and that is incredibly funny . one of the best parts about the dinner game ( besides that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film ) is the fact that while it's called the dinner game , there is no dinner or no game at all . the film's comedy owes almost everything to villeret , he's someone you can just look at and laugh . when the film is remade in the us ( with robin williams as the idiot ) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that is featured here . the supporting cast is good , but it's obvious who's in the center of attention . so , go see the dinner game while you can , this funny , original , and interesting french comedy gets  stars . 
 hollywood has a . 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . 
 apt pupil  -a review by bill chambers ( wchamber@netcom . ca ) ( visit my review archive , play some movie trivia , and more ! film freak central http : //www . geocities . com/~billchambers/ ) starring brad renfro , ian mckellan , elias koteas , david schwimmer screenplay by brandon boyce , based on the novella by stephen king directed by bryan singer " no man is an island , " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other things . bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . singer has yet to get keyser sÃ¶ze out of his system . his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the " right " or the " wrong " choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . 
 the happy bastard's 30-second review happy gilmore as a father ? of course ! that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . he's a hoot . directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . 
 floating life ( southern star - 1997 ) starring annette shun wah , annie yip , anthony wong , edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee , toby chan , toby wong screenplay by eddie ling-ching fong , clara law produced by bridget ikin directed by clara law running time : 95 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . -------------------------------------------------------------floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . the film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . ms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . however , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . 
 ( miramax - 1996 ) starring william baldwin , angela jones , bruce ramsay , mel gorham , lois chiles , daisy fuentes , barry corbin screenplay by john maass & reb braddock produced by john maass and raul puig directed by reb braddock running time : 94 minutes curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . to be specific , let me give you an example . do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . one particularly striking m . o . on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . no points for guessing what they do . her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . it's a great performance . reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . 
 for just a couple of years now , a certain film director has been doing for action films what marisa tomei did earlier this year for the " love interest " character in film--breathing life into it . if you've not guessed by now , the man i'm talking about is none other than john woo . the only problem is that mr . woo has been doing his thing over in japan , and not in the u . s . of a . woo's the killer had so much word of mouth in japan , that once the film arrived in the states in 1990 it was welcomed with a massive dose of critical praise . well , the wait is finally over . john woo is here , and his american debut goes the distance to prove that he is here to stay . the story is particularly simple : a vietnam vet is murdered by a group of trigger-happy hunters--partial to that race of human beings--and the man's daughter goes looking for him . it seems he was homeless , and to get the proper tour of her father's homeland , the daughter enlists the help of a down-and-out sailor named chance beaudreaux ( played by van damme ) . chance needs two-hundred bucks to ship out of new orleans , and figures that by taking this young and innocent woman up on her offer , he can get what he needs . to convince her that he's the man for the job , chance fights away some homeless thugs looking to rip natalie ( the daughter , played by yancy butler ) off of a few hundred dollars , using his fists and feet to crush bones like nothing you've ever seen in a van damme movie before . natalie is definitely convinced . she and chance soon discover that her father was murdered , and this leads them to cross paths with the leader of the afore-mentioned group ( played by lance henriksen ) . * and * we get another murder-of-a-homeless scene . the vet who's killed this time is someone chance knew as a friend , and--well , you can probably figure out the rest . the story * is * simple at heart , but it isn't really the story that's important here--it's the story * telling * . this is a dynamite action film . director john woo uses techniques--like slow-mo , quick-cut , and freeze frame--that other directors have either taken for granted or have been too afraid to use , and creates an entirely new kind of action movie that most american audiences have never seen before . it's exciting stuff , and it has a truly explosive impact to it ( especially in the climax , at an empty warehouse in the bayous ) . the characterizations * do * leave much to be desired--van damme has one grimacing expression plastered on his mug at all times ( does this guy * ever * smile . . . ? ) , and yancy butler doesn't have much to do here--but , again , these things are nothing more than serviceable to john woo's unique directorial style . he's a master at this kind of movie making . if you see hard target , but still want more woo , check out some of his earlier japanese work ( like the killer and hard boiled ) . these movies all have one thing in common : a superior artist at work . i can compare woo with quentin tarantino in that the two are fresh forces in hollywood who do not need or want to concede with any hollywood standards . target's ear-slicing scene had to be trimmed in order for the film to attain an r-rating . and perhaps that's saying something , too . woo has a little to learn about the united states as far as movies are concerned , and the mpaa and censorship . but it's far from too late , and if woo keeps up the good work he might even be able to break down the mpaa's standards on violence in the movies . 
 starring warren beatty , halle berry and oliver platt directed by warren beatty running time : 1 hour 40 minutes . warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) it's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . they're not cringe inducing , at least . the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . bulworth , then , is well worth watching . 
 starring denzel washington , john hannah , live schreiber , deborah kara unger , viscellous reon shannon , dan hedaya , harris yulin , david paymer , clancy brown , and rod steiger . directed by norman jewison written by armayan bernstein and dan gordon denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history . he is that amazing . the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids . " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in " shawshank redemption " ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 
 field of dreams almost defies description . although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : " if you build it , he will come . " then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . " if you build it , he will come . " and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates . and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to " ease his pain . " ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas . in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical . ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago " black sox " scandal . and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy . in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics . 
 drew barrymore has had a very good year . first , she did the wedding singer with adam sandler , and then she carried her own movie , ever after . both were huge winners at the box office . now she brings us home fries , a romantic comedy costarring catherine o'hara and luke wilson . luke wilson isn't the biggest name in hollywood or anything , but he is still a good actor . he and barrymore are dating in real life , after meeting on the set of this cute movie . barrymore stars as sally , a worker at a restaurant called burger matic . she is pregnant from the affair she had with a man named henry . henry's son , dorian ( luke wilson ) , and his other son , angus ( jake busey ) , accidentally kill their father by giving him a heart attack . their mother put them up to this because he had an affair with another woman . on the radio in the helicopter , they hear fast food workers on interference and figure that they know . so , dorian gets a job at burger matic , the same place where sally works , the woman who had an affair with his father . ok , right now , you are probably very lost , but so was i . as the movie goes on , dorian and sally fall in love , not knowing that sally is also in love with dorian's father . when dorian's mother ( catherine o'hara ) commands angus and dorian to kill sally , ( she finds out from pictures who the woman is ) dorian must stop them before the love of his life is killed . home fries has a very weird and original plot , not like any other movie i have ever seen . that really boosts a movie to a high level . drew barrymore gives an outstanding performance , her best since scream . this movie should boost luke wilson to a star level . catherine o'hara gives a very fake performance that was hard to believe . jake busey was very annoying and i wanted him to go away . shelley duvall did great , and you really believed how her character was feeling . home fries was also suspenseful in it's own way . i wanted certain things to happen and i couldn't tell if they were going to or not . there were a lot of laughs in home fries , but not crack up funny ones . home fries is a cute , small movie , which should make some pretty good money at the box office , but it wont be a blockbuster . it should keep some people just entertained . it is a very simple movie , nothing really complex about it ( except the plot ) . home fries was a really nice movie to watch on thanksgiving , and i enjoyed it a lot . 
 starring : gwyneth paltrow , john hannah , john lynch , jeanne tripplehorningredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition sliding doors is a love 'what if' story . the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . this leads to a life where helen moves out . helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . in story two , helen experiences a different fate . she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! " when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . there are minor inconveniences . since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ? 
 watching crash , the recurring thought that popped into my mind was `damn , i wonder how these people afford auto insurance . ' i mean , here we have a movie about people screwing like rabbits while at the same time crashing cars left and right . and , although crash's really made of a lot tougher stuff than the two of those , they constitute such a large amount of the plot and curious draw of this safe haven of sadomasochism that the producers used the quote `â€¦sex and car crashes' ( ironically , from a review that blasts the film ) to advertise their celluloid psychosexual psychosis . leave it to me to be thinking of auto insurance rates , when a sexy actresses like deborah kara unger is going at it onscreen . crash is the story of james ballard ( james spader , picking his most interesting ( and perverse ) role since sex , lies , and videotape ) ) , a man who is living in a marriage with a primal curse : his wife , catherine ( deborah kara unger ) , cannot reach orgasm . she loves sex â€“ her habits are downright nymphomaniacle and the marriage is open-ended â€“ but nothing she can do can make her reach orgasm . her husband makes this both his personal quest and problemâ€¦ the two wonder constantly about each other's sexual partners , go at it at least twice a day , and often have sex at the office . yet nothing's quite doing it for cathy . she's just not getting her big o . one day , while driving home from working on a car crash safety commercial , ballard has a head-on-collision with dr . helen remmington ( holly hunter ) . remmington's husband dies , flying through the windshield , and the last thing ballard witnesses before he passes out is remmington ripping open her shirt and proceeding to begin enjoying herself in the car . 
 every ant has his day . at least , that's what woody allen would have you think , in this twisted animated version of annie hall meets brazil . starting with a moody grass-scape of what turns out to be a quiet corner of central park , voiced-over by allen's `z' , a hapless worker ant who feels the weight of the colony--so to speak--on his back , antz tracks a lot like any allen flick . in fact , if it wasn't for all the forumla-driven bad guys , perilous situations , and narrow escapes , antz would be * exactly * like any other allen film . but this is animation , and that means kid-pleasing effects must plaster the screen . sadly , this hurts the story to the point where antz will quickly get lost in the shuffle of animated films coming out over the next year , despite its unique touches . to make matters worse , some of the more gruesome scenes , including an ant-termite battle that would leave private ryan wetting himself , are decidedly not for children . don't get me wrong , i thoroughly enjoyed the movie . and if the humdrum trailer for a bug's life is any indication , antz is going to be the best we'll see out of computer animation for awhile , at least until toy story 2 . but , to paraphrase z himself , a boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-changes-underlying-social-structure movie . . . just isn't that original . even if it is about ants . more story , less silly antics . maybe then i'll be inclined to put down my can of raid . . . . 
 directed by irwin winkler . cast : val kilmer , mira sorvino , kelly mcgillis , nathan lane , steven weber , bruce davison . 1999 - 128 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity and sexual situations ) . reviewed january 22 , 1999 . like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . on the basis of the overall story , " at first sight " is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , " awakenings . " what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . however , what helps " at first sight " rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer " you've got mail " immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual " love scenes , " and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the " big city . " the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . val kilmer , usually cast in the " macho " type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , " mighty aphrodite , " for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's " mimic , " 1998's " the replacement killers " ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with " at first sight " that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the " bad , " one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . the one misstep of " at first sight " is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . in " awakenings , " the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , " at first sight " comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . 
 shrek ( 2001 ) mike myers , eddie murphy , cameron diaz , john lithgow , vincent cassel . screenplay by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , roger s . h . schulman , based on the book by william steig . directed by andrew adamson , vicky jenson . 89 minutes . rated pg , 4 stars ( out of five stars ) review by ed johnson-ott , nuvo newsweekly www . nuvo . net archive reviews at http : //reviews . imdb . com/reviewsby ? edward + johnson-ott to receive reviews by e-mail at no charge , send subscription requests to ejohnsonott@prodigy . net or e-mail ejohnsonott-subscribe@onelist . com with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . all in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . but first the basics . based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way . all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! " ) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . the movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that'll do , donkey . that'll do " ) to " the graduate . " but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits â€“ pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " â€“ but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like " it's a small world . " which brings me to disturbing point number one . i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! put the past behind you ! there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . beyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . adding short jokes is simply mean . still , " shrek " is a rollicking good time . the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . to trot out a clichÃ© , " shrek " is fun for all ages . parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . 
 " oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! " mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . " didn't i sound just like a mother ? " " you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly . " i know , but i still can't believe it . i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? " marty , you see , is a grown-up twin . although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb . the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . in this storm are two sane individuals . the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication . as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night . " we all have our secrets , " jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . this is a house filled with them . ( when lesly calls it the family's " home " to mrs . pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their " house . " ) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , " made for each other , " the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship . they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . director mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . " were you poor ? " jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . " did you eat pies ? chicken pot pies ? " " pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , " lesly replies with her usual sincerity . " a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , " jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . " are we entertaining royalty ? " with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . 
 no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! i can't stand this anymore ! ' . there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! event horizon is highly recommendedÃ Ã but at your own risk ! it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . 
 capsule : jackie chan teams up with his old buddy sammo hung to give us another zero-calorie fight-fest . gloriously foolish fun . my wife had this to say about mr . nice guy : " as entertainment , it's great . as a movie , it sucks . " i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought , the acting was hopeless , the script a throwaway . but it showcased jackie chan's raucous physical comedy -- " martial arts " is the wrong word for it -- and was therefore more than worth it . it isn't the all-out roar of joy that rumble in the bronx and especially supercop were , but it's still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda , and is all the better for it -- even if he's in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist who's just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence , and there's a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks , henchmen , cigar-smoking baddies , and cops . that's about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures , like his girlfriend ( miki lee ) and his female assistant , who have a howlingly funny scene that , due to language barriers , cannot be repeated here . some things you gotta see to believe . jackie's stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it : it's like play , or maybe a kind of dance . one scene has jackie getting into a fight in traffic -- on top of a flood of pepsi cans . another scene involves an unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and corridors . hung ( who directed ) plays it like an homage to the road runner and wile e . coyote cartoons . ( hung also films things a little more loosely and fluidly than staney tong did : we get a lot of steadicam work , lots of things going on in different sectors of the screen . ) another , even more mind-boggling scene , involves jackie being forced to fight with henchmen holding his limbs back with bungee cords . ( yes , he manages to get the upper hand with that one as well . don't ask how . ) the final scene gives us the grand guignol ( sans blood ) ending that a movie like this deserves . here's a hint : in the first five minutes , we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time , jackie was driving . 
 alien resurrection ( r )  ) 1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 
 for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . 
 from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go hoser ! ) director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " . 
 starring tom hanks , david morse , michael duncan , doug hutchinson , james cromwell , bonnie hunt , patricia clarkson , barry pepper , michael jeter , sam rockwell , graham greene , jeffrey demunn , dabbs greer , eve brent , harry dean stanton and gary sinise . it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . his pain creates pain for the viewer . however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . " the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . the speed in " the green mile " is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

" the faculty , " the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's " desperado " and 1996's " from dusk till dawn " ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's " scream " and 1997's " scream 2 " ) , is being called a cross between " invasion of the body snatchers " and " the breakfast club , " and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . the six characters , as in " the breakfast club , " can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . " the faculty " is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original " scream , " and rodriguez , whose " from dusk till dawn " is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . the plotline of " the faculty , " involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from " invasion of the body snatchers , " to " the puppet masters , " to " invaders from mars , " so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . the performances in " the faculty " were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( " t2 : judgement day " ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the " queen " alien , many of the faculty members disappear . it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , " the faculty " is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . - copyright 1998 by dustin putman dustin putman's film reviews  
 starring kirk douglas , william bendix , lee grantkirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking . " detective story " features one of kirk douglas's finest performances . he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in . the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . secrets i would not dream of giving away . with a name like " detective story " , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of " nypd blue " , but it doesn't quite work out that way . however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . the performances all around are fantastic . douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time . we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . which brings me back to douglas . he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father . how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these days : he's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . 
 easily the most anticipated , most delayed film release of 1997 , james cameron's $220 million " titanic " steams into theaters with a slew of questions to answer , most notably was it worth the wait , the hype , and all that money ? well . " titanic " is big , that's for sure . the size and scope of the production are evidenced by a massive , detailed replica of the white star liner , impressive visual effects , countless extras , and a love story transcending the atlantic ocean itself . that , plus the fact that the storyline is played out over three and a quarter hours , and we're talking epic proportions here . " titanic , " alas , doesn't quite live up to its promise or its much-ballyhooed pricetag . but it's an entertainment on a grand scale nonetheless . water-bound dramas are rarely without their production problems . cameron's own " the abyss " had its fair share , and those dogging " waterworld " ( prior to " titanic , " the most expensive movie in hollywood history ) are legendary . on " titanic , " it's clear that cameron the get-it-right-and-budget-be-damned director fairs far better than cameron the sounds-about-right screenwriter . while the ship sinks convincingly and spectacularly enough , leads leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet get saddled with lots of cornball situations and dialogue . cameron's trump card was to make " titanic " first and foremost a love story . however , his straightforward approach to that fateful night on april 15th , 1912 lends itself better to his visual overtures than his romantic undertones . dicaprio plays jack dawson , a freewheeling , penniless ( are there any other kind ? ) artist from steerage who's smitten by winslet's rose dewitt bukater , a stifled society damsel from the upper decks . cameron paints the haves and the have-nots a little too black and white--the rich are all stuffy , boring snots while the poor are the only ones who really know how to have fun--but on the darker side , billy zane is particularly good as rose's suave , callous fiancÃ© cal hockley . of the innumerable versions of this ocean-going tragedy , this one might be the first to imply that the titanic hit the iceberg because its lookouts were distracted by a couple making out on deck . however , even at its epic length , " titanic " is never boring . time skips by quickly , and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy , including frances fisher ( as rose's disapproving mother ruth ) and bernard hill , in an underwritten role as the ship's ineffectual captain . perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film occurs during its present-day setup , when a rugged salvage expert ( played by bill " we're toast , man ! " paxton ) has one of his staff explain , via a fascinating computer animation , how the ship went down in the icy waters of the north atlantic , sending 1 , 500 of its 2 , 200 passengers and crew to their deaths . all this , of course , is represented in larger-than-life cameron-a-rama later in the film , when the tragedy of 1912 is stunningly recreated . at this point in " titanic , " dicaprio and winslet take a back seat to the spectacle and , like the rest of us , hang on for dear life . 
 the australian documentary the diplomat gives a nearly complete overview of the situation in east timor up to its august 1999 elections . it starts with the historical background of this small island's tribulations : since the 16th century until 1975 , the island was a portuguese colony . then , with the end of the portuguese revolution , east timor declared its independence and was immediately invaded by indonesia , its giant neighbor . the focus of the film is josÃ© ramos horta , a political activist who represents the eastern timorese resistance historic leader , xanana gusmao , who was imprisoned in indonesia for a 20-year sentence . horta is a 1996 nobel prize winner who has been fighting for the independence of this little-known island for 24 years . the most compelling aspect of the film is its ability to convey how the tragic events of east timor and its desperate struggle for independence have been largely ignored by the world . since east timor has no army to support its claims for autonomy , horta says it must have been an act of god that his people had survived . horta's life is that of a peripatetic fighter who is exiled from the country the independence of which is his life mission . the challenge of horta's mission is accentuated by the fact that there is no unity among the leaders of east timor ; some of them are satisfied by living in a country annexed to its oppressors , others are adamant to fight for complete independence till the end . the film follows horta , almost always dog-tired , from one conference on the east timorese crisis to another and intersperses horta's diplomatic career with footage of hot events happening in east timor : president suharto resigns , habibie takes his place , nothing changes . indonesia itself has enough to worry about and when its economic crisis reaches the bottom of the barrel , indonesian foreign minister ali alatas is sent to deliver to the world promises of security and protection for east timor . while horta's mother , natalina , recollects how indonesian militia attacked her residence and took the lives of her children , the actual footage testifies the acts of barbaric genocide that took place on the island . the film hits all the appropriate strings by conveying how murder , torture , rape , all kinds of physical , sexual , and psychological violations have been the daily life of the people of east timor . it clearly exemplifies the frightening hypocrisy of the indonesian government which declares the crisis stable while more and more people are being brutally executed . unfortunately , up until the depiction of the 1999 democratic election in east timor , the film more or less plods along . it is only then that the film picks up the pace by showing that just four hours after the official announcement , the defeated militia gangs start to set east timor on fire . there is a moment of almost sublime irony when president bill clinton visits indonesia with the intention to stop the genocide and bring un peacekeeping forces to the country . he is greeted with a military ceremony that , in my opinion , signifies the irreconcilable difference between the east and the west . ironically , the portrait of josÃ© ramos horta , an indefatigable fighter who broke the silence about east timor in the ( disinterested ) western press , doesn't come out as memorable or inspiring . unquestionably , the film is very effective and involving due to its subject matter , without a mawkish triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed . but what should have been a celebration of human tenacity comes out as an intelligent film , though with a somewhat insipid portrayal of its hero . 
 cast : dennis quaid , james caviezel , shawn doyle , elizabeth mitchell , andre braugher , noah emmerich written by : toby emmerich directed by : gregory hoblit running time : 117 minutes when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . such was the case with frequency . every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . it looked awful . it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . it looked like a flop . well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . frequency boasts a compelling story line . an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . including john's mother . this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ? yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense . most films are like that . don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .

 cast : pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , chris tucker director : quentin tarantino producer : lawrence bender screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the book rum punch by elmore leonard cinematography : guillermo navarro u . s . distributor : miramax films it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination â€“ all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlighted as an " actor " with several decidedly unmemorable performances . now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts â€“ an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . jackie brown's lone " innovation " is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn't exactly an original technique â€“ it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's " banyon " ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds . soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . 
 with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , " wow . . . " like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien " phantoms . " whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a " zeus cannon , " dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a " wave " using eight collected " spirits " to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't . it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . why do these aliens feed on souls ? if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? what is so special about the " spirits " that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking . for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you're more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . there's no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . 
 eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . 
 there's good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that's chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have . you ain't never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( " heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . " ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is " be a man , " the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , " be a man " accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george " mr . sulu " takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , " alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ? " " well , there's mr . myagi . . . " " good . " " and mr . sulu . " " perfect . we've got ourselves a movie now .

 " high fidelity " ( 2000 )  directed by stephen frears written by d . v . devincentis , steve pink , john cusack , and scott michael rosenberg starring john cusack , iben hjejle , jack black , todd louiso , lisa bonet , catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor , joan cusack , natasha gregson wagner , and tim robbins just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . but these aren't any girlfriendsâ€¦these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . the plot in three words is : women and music . the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . 
 after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . remember , the robot ? it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . " the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . " upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . " this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . " mate with her ! " spencer exclaims . " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . " the show has many funny twists . in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . oh , and eating is pretty funny too . spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * . when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully . 
 go -a review by bill chambers ( go@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring sarah polley , desmond askew , jay mohr , scott wolf screenplay by john august directed by doug liman go's is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive . a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier . in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go . but i digress . go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) . i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

 one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . mother-in-law jokes prevail . furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . this is what binds the movie together . joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . 
 the relaxed dude rides a roller coasterthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " . the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " . lebowski's passion is bowling . when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . even worse , they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . the kidnappers are impossibly inept . the dude and his cronies are even worse . every plan goes awry . you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " . the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement . the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket . he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes . a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .

  jackie brown ( miramax - 1997 ) starring pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , michael bowen , chris tucker screenplay by quentin tarantino , based on the novel rum punch by elmore leonard produced by lawrence bender directed by quentin tarantino running time : 155 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( " $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn " ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel " rum punch " ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . 
 a miramax pictures release . starring robin williams , matt damon , ben affleck , stellan skarsgard , minnie driver , casey affleck , cole hauser , george plimpton . script by ben affleck and matt damon . produced by lawrence bender . directed by gus van sant . running time : 125 mins . rated r . " good will hunting " is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , " prodigy child " film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick . unusually directed by gus van sant , " good will hunting " overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent . the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams . in a nutshell , that's it . the core of the " good will hunting " is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by " chasing amy's " ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer . but it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( " awakenings " was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death . damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein . his rich , complex character is the pulp of " good will hunting . " everything else pales in comparison . " good will hunting " exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike " little man tate " or " phenomenon " , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned . 
 one of the best-ever names for a holiday special ( sure as hell beats frosty returns ) hits home video a year after its tv premiere , in this animated production from simpsons creator matt groening . based on a book by j . otto seibold and vivian walsh , olive's a hip dash of christmas humor and fun amidst specials that have just made little kids cry all these years . see , olive's not really a reindeer - she's a dog . a strange dog . voiced by drew barrymore , she speaks english to her owner tim ( jay mohr ) , doesn't dig for bones , and won't chase cars . while listening to the radio on christmas eve , she hears that santa may cancel his delivery , as blitzen is injured . he announces ( in a 90's soundbite ) , that he'll just have to rely on " all of the other reindeer . " olive is so caught up in the holidays , she thinks santa is talking about her . even her pet flea can't believe it . once it's set that she's really a lonely misfit -- a holiday story staple -- she's off to the north pole with a shifty penguin named martini ( the matrix's joe pantoliano ) . they catch a " mauvehound bus " driven by a weirdo named richard stands ( snl's tim meadows ) , who once thought the pledge of allegiance was for him ( say it out loud ) . but it's not just an easy bus trip that'll get olive to santaland . our villain is a demented mailman ( simpsons veteran dan castellaneta ) who just goes postal during the holiday season due to the weight of the all his deliveries . he'd love for santa's cancellation to hold up , so he's on his own quest to stop olive and company . as with any good simpsons episode , groening's writer -- simpsons and david letterman staffer steve young -- fills the story and landscape with bad puns and inside visuals that welcome the adults into the action just as much as the kids . the laughs don't have the stinging irony of the simpsons , but they are certainly playful enough to hold most viewers' interest . as is the animation , a freaky mix of multi-dimensional backgrounds and flat characters . it looks like a strange combination of a kid's video game and a set of colorforms , giving it a splashy , original look . there are a few musical numbers that whiz by , most notably the postman's lament about delivering the mail ( the best lyrics in the feature ) , and a ditty headed by rem's michael stipe , singing as schnitzel the reindeer . just a few minutes into olive , i wondered why drew barrymore was voicing our hero . she's not really a voice actor , and doesn't sound too expressive . then i read that she and partner nancy juvonen are also executive producers on this special . drew may want to audition a few others next time . but , like most of olive , drew's voice grew on me . this is a special that's hard not to enjoy , and it thankfully avoids any sappy finale . it may not enter the pantheon of holiday classics , but it's just too damn cute not to watch once a year . especially when olive wags that little tail . that's great . 
 " a dream of dark and troubling things . " -- david lynchthere are those who say " eraserhead " makes little sense , and then there are those who say that " eraserhead " isn't supposed to make sense . i'm with the second camp : if " eraserhead " made any sense at all , it wouldn't be nearly as interesting . " eraserhead " is allegedly a horror movie , but i put it instead on that small shelf of films that abandon all pretense at being entertainment and just give you an experience : " begotten " , " the reflecting skin " and alejandro jodorowsky's head-trips ( " el topo " , " the magic mountain " ) are close cousins in spirit to this film . there is a story , sort of . henry spencer ( lynch regular john nance ) is a nerdish , creepy-looking man living in a squalid little apartment . he's accidentally impregnated his girlfriend , and the baby turns out to be a vile little creature that looks something like e . t . after thalidomide . the news about the pregnancy , by the way , comes out during a dinner where the main course consists of chickens the size of one's fist that still move and spurt blood when sliced into . there's also a strangely deformed woman who seems to live in henry's radiator . . . and by this point you're either shaking your head in dismay or wondering where to find the movie . i guess that means i've done my job . " eraserhead " needs to be seen on the big screen to work properly . on tv , the black-on-black photography -- this is the single darkest movie ever made , and i don't just mean in terms of subject matter ! -- reproduces very poorly . also , on tv , the black and white images don't saturate the senses the way they do in a theater . there's also the most creative use of sound in almost any movie i've ever seen : not a single scene in the film is silent . there's always something rumbling , hissing , clattering , bubbling , booming away in either the background or the next room over , and it has the same effect on the audience's nerves as a dentist's drill . before david lynch started screwing with america's mind via " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " , he spent five years , on and off , making " eraserhead " . it shows . there is a level of obsessive care in every frame of this film that many movies costing hundreds of times more don't show at all . people may wonder : if this thing's so weird and so repulsive , why did i give it three and a half stars ? because it dares to be different and succeeds . i don't automatically reward every movie that's " experimental " with a positive review , but they sure deserve the benefit of the doubt . -----------== posted via deja news , the discussion network ==---------- http : //www . dejanews . com/ search , read , discuss , or start your own 
 what starts out as a monotonous talking-head musical history lecture turns into a rich land of louisiana discovery , as robert mugge adventures into the various landscapes of that colorful state . three different sections of louisiana are documented along the journey , northern , southern , and southwestern louisiana , separated by maps and cutesy subtitles . the latter two are the best installments , in that they allow the charismatic performers direct camera time without the interference of a boring onscreen interviewer . each county has a different character , style , instruments , and sound , all distinct in their origins , as local experts tell us , and mugge respectfully picks up these discerning traits . where one town declares that race isn't an issue , the other shows how racial tensions actually aided in black and white musicians inspiring one another . southern louisiana has a strong cajun/creole base , while northern louisiana leans towards guitar and a cappella singing . as a whole , this documentary is well layered with performance and testimony but could easily have been shorter and made the same impact on an audience . in the first section especially , numerous concert performances run superfluously through an entire song , with the camera panning to and fro , looking for something to do . every person put in front of the camera is introduced , but only half the multitude leave much of a mark . the director of the louisiana folk festival expounds on the glories of louisiana's past for an interminable period of time , but most of what he says goes in what ear and out the other . on the other hand , there's a remarkably short section devoted to a 28-year disc jockey veteran , sister pearlee tolliver . she spends her two hours on the radio exclaiming commercials in a gospel voice , with a couple of records thrown in , and she amuses too much to forget . as standard documentaries go , the expected talking heads are mixed in with live concert performances . but most endearing are the discussions with actual performers about their influences and playing style , and reminiscences about their colleagues . these interviews , juxtaposed with the local connoisseurs , provide a solid foundation for the musically ignorant and die hard fan . one of the best portraits is that of kermit ruffins , a local favorite in southwestern louisiana . he takes the historical roots of jazz and blues and mixes them with his own modern experiences growing up in the streets . popularity hasn't blown his ego either , as once in a while he barbeques for his audience out of the back of his truck . other details compliment this musical voyage . the first record store in louisiana , floyd's , is renowned for shipping impossible-to-find music all over the world . the original owner still runs it and helps to promote new talent such as rosie ledet . rosie was a housewife who taught herself how to play the accordion and she now sings and tours with her husband's band . at once mousy and humble , this lady has gone on to break ground for female artists in the zydeco field . before walking into to this film , one might think that all of louisiana could be clumped into a simple stereotype . it takes a while to be interested in the material , but once the filmmaker moves onto southern louisiana , it's hard to look away from the screen . 
 a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite . they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too . they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb . men in black is a four-star three-star film . ( hope you could follow that one ) men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun . just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use . after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " . nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes . the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof . naturally nobody believes his story . . . nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of . edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib . edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) . james edwards no longer exists . meet agent jay . agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties . eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play . a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it . the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does . barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely . it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed . a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be . this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer . will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch . definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me ! 
 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . 
 on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . he is insane , apparently . the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax . but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . bad cutting puts the timing way out . in other words , he's almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . proof that he can do it , if he tries . . . 
 starring : ashley judd , tommy lee jones , annabeth gish , bruce greenwood , michael gaston . rated r for violence , language and some sexuality . underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . he is a man who has had his share of bad things . while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . whatever happens the film was excellent to me . i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . reviewed by brandon herring october 13 , 1999 . brandon herring movie review heaven ( http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html 
 as south park : bigger , longer and uncut opens , the citizens of the famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune . the birds are chirping , the sun is shining , and the friendly inhabitants are smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune . enter the foursome of cartman , kyle , stan and kenny , the infamous group of elementary school children that the tv show is based upon . they see an ad bearing the names of their favorite fart-lighting duo of terrance and phillip , who are appearing in their very first feature length movie ( a canadian production ) . and so they venture forth to the local cineplex , where they are shamefully turned down from seeing this graphic , r-rated feature . after bribing a homeless man to accompany them as their `parental guardian' , the boys make it in to watch the movie , unaware that the profane language they learn will soon thereafter destroy their quiet and peaceful town . south park is a tv show that grew immensely popular on comedy central . mostly , of course , with the less demanding younger viewers , who found the idea of swearing and offensive cardboard children to be just their cup of tea . now that co-creators trey parker and matt stone are free of their television rating confines , they have pushed the envelope as far as it can possibly go . the south park movie is more raunchy , vulgar and repeatedly crude than anything you have probably ever seen . the obscenities flow so consistently that unwilling viewers may be scarred for life , left to babble on in profane gibberish . the reason the film exists is that parker and stone can take revenge on the mpaa ( that's the motion picture association of america ) , with whom they've experienced a complicated past . but , they won't stop there . how many groups , minorities and individuals does the south park movie stab in the back ? with the exception of the mpaa , there is ( ahem * ) black people , jewish people , gay people , anne murray , celine dion , jar jar binks , the baldwin brothers , saddam hussein , brian boitano , bill gates , barbara streisand , and most blatantly of all : canada ! parker and stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we canadians , from speech patterns to flag-wearing and beyond . it would be advisable for anyone who is easily offended to avoid this film , at all costs . but back to the plot . after the south park children begin to utter shocking four-letter words as part of their regular vocabulary , the mothers take action . forming mac ( mothers against canada ) , they take their case to president clinton , forcing him to proclaim war on the neighboring country for polluting the american children's minds with their obscene movie productions . terrance and phillip are thereby scheduled to be executed , with a pre-celebrity bash including winona ryder and big gay al . the south park children decide to band together , stop the bloodbath , and save the lives of their acting icons before all is lost . let me first say that i laughed . lord help me , i nearly busted a gut during some uproarious musical numbers . yes , in case you didn't know already , the south park movie is basically a feature-length animated musical . the lyrics are often side-splitting and many of the songs have an enjoyable beat , especially the re-enactment of the widely cherished `kyle's mom's a b--ch' , performed with eager enthusiasm by cartman himself . as a sub-plot , kenny sets himself on fire while attempting to light his own fart , and descends to hell . there he meets satan , who is having a heated affair with none other than saddam hussein . for such ( intentionally ) crummy animation , there are some impressive computer-generated visuals down below . unfortunately , this and many other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into disgusting vulgarity . south park : bigger , longer and uncut nearly received an nc-17 from the mpaa , and for good reason ; this film is not for young audiences . while a half-hour episode is nicely filling , the 90-minute movie begins to lose fuel as it nears the conclusion . but some sequences are so hilarious , and some pop culture references so cleverly placed , you just have to appreciate the effort . south park : bigger , longer and uncut breaks every rule in the book , and if you have the courage , you just might find it entertaining . 
 krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 
 tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . that's a shocking 100 times profit ! rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . tbwp is simply smart . filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . simply amazing in that respect , i must say . talk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . you have to see it for yourself . i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! 
 capsule : starts off as a legal thriller , but mutates into something much closer to the heart -- and features gene hackman in a typically excellent performance . some movies lead you wrong , and that's a good thing . the chamber , adapted from the john grishamn novel , starts off as a typical legal-thriller-with-a-twist , but then slowly turns into a different sort of story , about one man trying to find the truth about the past and another man trying to find the truth about himself . the two men are adam hall , a young chicago laywer , and his grandfather , sam cayhall . cayhall is a product of the worst breeds of southern racism , in whose fold he built and detonated several bombs . " i never meant to kill anyone , " he repeats angrily , but bombs are generally not designed to do much else , and three trials and countless appeals later , he is now on death row . hall , his grandson , has decided to take on the eleventh-hour defense . hall and cayhill do not like each other . cayhill has no use for lawyers -- most of the reasons , it seems at first , are blatantly racist , and don't bear repeating here ( even though they are delivered with consummate skill by hackman ) . hall doesn't like the bitter old man , but he smells a great deal is being held away from a lot of people's noses here , and digs . he finds a lot . as the movie unwound , i felt it could have gone one of two ways : either it could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish ( the way the dreadful a time to kill ended up ) , or it could pay closer attention to the people in the story . it takes the second road , and is all the better for it . and be warned : as a result , we don't get a nice , tidy conclusion -- a lot of threads are left dangling , probably deliberately , since the real conclusion of the movie is in the way hackman's character handles his oncoming fate . eventually we see that his racism is not so much a philosophy as a way of warding off terrible grief and hurt , and self-hatred ( as is the case with most virulently racist people , they compensate violently for not having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis ) . hall ( played by chris o'donnell with maturity and grace ) also has a transformation of his own , but a smaller one : sometimes it's not possible to use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong , just to comment on it . he resents his grandfather for using the same tired excuses , but at the same time batters patiently at the man's defenses , knowing that it's only a matter of time before the imminence of the clock will get him to say something true to his heart . he does .

" the tailor of panama " is a different kind of spy movie . despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carré , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . osnard offers harry a way out . he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . osnard turns in reports about the " silent opposition , " a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . the metropolis , described by one character as " casablanca without heroes " pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . " the tailor of panama " succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . 
 review by scott hunt . visit me at movie hunt http : //netdirect . net/~hunt/index . html cast : chow yun-fat , jodie foster , bai ling director : andy tennant writer : anna leonowens , steve meerson , peter krikes anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . anna function is to help provide that link . the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . it shows a seduction of intelligence . ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 
 scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . . . scream 2 ! 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled " stab " , which has been developed into a major motion picture . as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of " stab " , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown " copycat " sets out to repeat what's been done . . . and finish what hasn't ! of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . i will note , however , that the " whodunit ? " did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . all the actors outdo themselves here . we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . like they say , don't mess with perfection . . . but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ? 
 when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other " martial arts " flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . 
 rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odoen ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by uip on april 7 , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 126 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by stephen soderbergh ; produced by danny devito , michael shamberg , stacey sher . written by susannah grant . photographed by ed lachmann ; edited by anne v . coates . it's astounding , how many of us turn into lawyers when we get wrapped up in cases . i remember the louise woodward affair , for example , when i knew all the evidence from the courtroom pictures on tv , and was able to reel off detailed arguments crushing people who had just looked at her and assumed she was guilty . passion about justice is what makes people consider law careers ; it chills me when i see sell-outs trying to condemn obviously innocent people , or using dishonest tactics to help the guilty . stephen soderbergh's " erin brockovich " is a brilliant story of anger turning into courtroom skills ; a david versus goliath-style exposé in the great tradition of " silkwood " , " a civil action " and " the insider " . at its centre is a woman with no judiciary training or expertise , whose mind was not complicated with red tape or histories of statutes , and whose discoveries and simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the biggest lawsuits in american history . her name , of course , is erin brockovich ( julia roberts ) , and when we meet her in the opening scenes of this film , she's just a struggling single mother who has failed to win a personal injury settlement . soon after , she hustles her way into a filing job at the firm of her solicitor . the boss , ed masry ( albert finney ) , objects , but erin makes her services hard to refuse : " i need a job . don't make me beg . if it doesn't work out , fire me . " when handling the real estate documents of a town in california , erin notices something odd -- they all include medical records . researching this further , she stumbles on the information that the area's water supplier , pacific gas & electric , has been using a dangerous chemical known as 'hexavalent chromium 3' in their pipes . 'chromium 3' can penetrate the body to cause pretty much any illness , including all forms of cancer . what's especially horrific is that pg&e knew about the hazards of their water and misinformed its customers that chromium was good for them . the people took the company's word , even when they all started to get sick , until erin brockovich revealed her findings , and used her common touch to encourage the folks to stand up and take legal action . brockovich is not always a likeable character . at the start of the movie , when no job interviewers will look past her lack of a resumé or qualifications , her feeling of victimisation is preposterous . she seems to think anyone who isn't stuck in the poverty trap must be some sort of snob . and she displays gross arrogance when defending her wardrobe , which is made up of mini-skirts , tight boob tubes and high-heeled boots . " as long as i have one ass instead of two , " she tells masry when he points out that his office has a dress code , " i'll wear what i god damn well please . " but none of these flaws take away from her achievement , which is that she worked hard , taught herself some tough skills , became a great friend and advocate for victims of an abominable crime , and managed to raise a family at the same time . this is one of roberts's most impressive performances , her best since " pretty woman " ( 1990 ) , because she really does look affected by the pressures her character has to cope with . she allows herself to be vulnerable , with a voice that can quiver and stumble . she doesn't always have the answers , and could break down at any minute . there are one or two irritating episodes of grandstanding , where she rattles off snappy , heroic speeches that probably took the screenwriter hours to write ; but that's kind of obligatory , and i'm just glad that such moments don't dominate the film . " erin brockovich " is not necessarily better than the films i previously mentioned , but has advantages over each of them in one way or another . it's more fast-paced and accessible than " silkwood " , angrier about its subject matter than " a civil action " and less sidetracked than " the insider " . i'm starting to love director soderbergh's new visual style , too , which he also used in " out of sight " , and mixes the colour palette and star power of big studio movies with the documentary camera and quiet pacing of realistic independents . sounds distracting . but it's oddly compelling . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic's website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic 
 starring steve martin , eddie murphy , heather graham , christine baranski , jamie kennedy , robert downey jr . , and terrence stamp . the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money . in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger . he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . will bowfinger be able to make his film ? or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . 
 hype ? sheesh , like no other . this side of titanic , good will hunting has enjoyed some of the most baffling , gushing praise of the year . does either film deserve it ? not really . let's look at the facts : you have matt damon as will hunting -- apparently the smartest man on the face of the earth who can also kick anyone's ass over breakfast , and has a history of run-ins with the law . oh no ! affleck is his down-to-earth best bud . driver , the hoity-toity love interest . williams and skarsgård as hunting's mentors , the guys that rescue him from a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer . and it is made abundantly clear that the film is also about the class stuggle in boston . now that i've typed it out , it sounds ridiculous , and the more i think about it , the more it really * is * . the plot and theme of good will hunting hinge upon the idea that it's tough for the smartest man in the world to make the move from crumb-bum to respectable member of society . why ? because ( a ) " just because he has a gift he doesn't have to use it ! " and ( b ) he had a troubled childhood . well , boo hoo ! the more i write , the more it sounds like a topic on " jenny jones " : boy geniuses on the wrong side of the tracks . right . if any believable character had this guy's abilities , this movie would have been much different . . . and probably much shorter , too . i realize i'm ranting here , but the pop psychology of hunting reaches such a high level of annoyance so that when williams tearfully confronts damon with the film's signature line of -- i kid you not -- " it's not your fault , " it just gets silly . and it lost me . the script , written by damon and affleck , is otherwise humorous and keeps you entertained . van sant's direction is inexplicably amateurish and features some lousy voice dubbing . williams is pretty good in his role , and for what it's worth , so is damon , even though the character is ludicrous . all told , the film has plenty of enjoyable moments , but it's just not the deep experience the filmmakers want you to believe it is . and neither was titanic . that ought to guarantee me plenty of hate mail for the next few weeks . fire away . 
 directed by curtis hanson . screenplay by steve kloves , based on the novel by michael chabon . starring michael douglas , tobey maguire , robert downey jr . running time : 114 minutes . rated aa . reviewed on march 19th , 2000 . a quiet , understated character piece , " wonder boys " is the sort of movie which , when recalled afterward , seems more like a dream than something actually experienced . slow-moving but never plodding , funny and original without being absurd , it is a pleasurable journey through one man's personal struggles . grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a university of pittsburgh english professor who wrote a critically-acclaimed novel seven years ago and hasn't published anything since . most people think tripp is washed up , but the truth is that his new novel just isn't finished yet ; it is now two thousand single-spaced pages long and counting . tripp , whose wife has just left him , is having an affair with the university chancellor , sara gaskell ( frances mcdormand ) . sara's husband walter ( richard thomas ) is the head of the english department and hence grady's boss . tripp's most promising student is james leer ( tobey maguire ) , a dour and eccentric youth held in disdain by most of his classmates . the lone exception is hannah green ( katie holmes ) , who is also boarding with grady and is clearly interested in taking their relationship beyond the academic . the movie takes place during wordfest , a weekend-long writers' convention . the gaskells host a party to kick off wordfest , during which sara reveals to grady that she is pregnant . going outside for a draw , tripp ( aptly named , given that he spends most of the movie under the influence of drugs , both prescription and otherwise ) encounters james , standing in the backyard with a gun he insists is just a fake . the two sneak upstairs to have a look at walter's collection of memorabilia . when grady is attacked by the gaskells' dog , james shoots it dead . at a loss , tripp ends up lugging the canine corpse around in his trunk until he can figure out what to do about it . all this is just set-up for a sometimes harrowing , always amusing odyssey through the streets of pittsburgh and the problems which plague grady's life . he finds himself having to deal not just with the end of his marriage and the complication of his affair , not just with the dead dog and a stolen piece of walter's collection , not just with editor terry crabtree ( robert downey jr ) whose own job is riding on the publication of tripp's new novel , but with the enigma that is james leer . james isn't just a writer ; the entirety of his behavior is one big creative process ( at one point , intoxicated , he begins narrating out loud ) and it is impossible to take anything he says or does at face value : the fake-gun-that-isn't is just the tip of the iceberg of james' fantasies and deceptions . " wonder boys " is a smart movie that understands its characters and takes the time to develop and explore them fully . written by steve kloves from the novel by michael chabon , it is populated by believable individuals who make believable choices , not ones dictated by stereotypical hollywood expectations . for example , both terry and james are clearly not strictly heterosexual , but when they finally do end up in bed together , it is dealt with almost offhandedly . the event is just a natural development of both characters , and the script does not grind to a halt to exploit it . nothing in " wonder boys " feels staged or melodramatic ; realism seethes from its characters , their relationships with each other , and the decisions they make . but perhaps this is all to be expected . " wonder boys " is a movie all about making choices and the consequences of avoiding them , and a film with such a theme lives and dies on the conviction of its characters . grady has spent the past half-decade evading decisions , and it has cost him his marriage . here , then , is the story of how he comes to rise above his personal apathy and seize control of his life . nowhere is this theme of making choices more clearly illustrated than with grady's epic novel . even hannah , grady's potential new love interest , finds it impossible to finish , but not because it is poorly written . on the other hand , hannah thinks it is beautiful , but she tells grady , " you didn't make any choices " : grady has not found the will to leave anything out of the text , and as a result it has ballooned to mammoth proportions . the manuscript's final fate depicts another important fact about decisions : that sometimes they're made for you , not by you . the movie's dialogue is sparkling throughout , and there are plenty of laughs , many of them derived from the film's frank view of reality . surprisingly for a movie which muses on so deep a theme , " wonder boys " has many of the elements of a screwball comedy , complete with mistaken identities and misplaced valuables . but the screwball elements are always in service to the overall plot , complementing it rather than fragmenting the film . as a result , " wonder boys " is appealing and enjoyable on a number of different levels . the acting is uniformly excellent . douglas finds just the right note as the harried grady , portraying him as confused and aimless without making him seem weak . maguire , always a quiet , reserved actor , is a perfect fit as james -- he is quirky , inspired and fragile , all at the same time . amongst the supporting cast , richard knox gives a hilarious performance as a man who claims to be the real owner of grady's battered car . for a movie about choices , " wonder boys " makes all the right ones . it is smart and well-acted , and the top-notch script finds a good balance between drama and comedy . although its sheer placidness may work against it in such a crowded box office , it should not be overlooked . this may be one of the first oscar contenders of the year 2000 . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/wonderboys . html 
 written by : francis ford coppola , adapted from the novel by john grisham starring : matt damon , claire danes , danny devito , jon voight , and danny glover ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . will rudy defeat leo ? will he enjoy being a lawyer ? opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . 'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . 
 okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it . the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them " to do " his wife . well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . and the fun starts their . this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off . it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy . i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace . even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming . if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good . you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place ! 
 labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . the future was much worse than his vision . the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . in their vocabulary , word " arms " is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . 
 release date : march 31 , 1999 starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , hugo weaving , marcus chong directed by : andy wachowski , larry wachowski distributed by : warner brothers mpaa rating : r ( sci-fi violence ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/matrix . htm perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story . unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length . contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy . only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach . the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . 
 by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . grade : b- ,  
 capsule : perversely entertaining hong kong action with the god of gamblers himself , chow yun-fat . mira sorvino ain't bad either , but the main attraction is the movie's glossy look . chow yun-fat commands the screen the way very few actors do , no matter where they're from . see him in the dozens of other movies he's done for the hong kong studios ( and hang yourself if you haven't seen him in john woo's masterpieces the killer and hard-boiled ) . he is one of the few cult-movie figures who lives up to and beyond the hype . in the replacement killers , he strides onscreen as if just coming in from another hk production without losing a beat . hk fan that i am , i held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite some time . the replacement killers was designed to be chow's big u . s . debut vehicle , but it also serves as the debut for director antoine fuqua ( whose only previous directorial job was the " gangster's paradise " video for coolio ) . both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie , which helps to buoy it all up out of the routine and into the realm of the special . the plot is not the main attraction . chow plays a hitman who crumbles when faced with the prospect of having to ice a policeman , and decides to flee the country . to that end , he enlists mira sorvino's character -- a tattooed forgery artist who lives in an apartment that looks like a close cousin to the one j . f . sebastian inhabited in blade runner . then bad guys with tons of firepower come gunning for both of them , and they have to hit the road . fuqua knows his hk action staples . the movie is saturated with highly choreographed violence . the whole movie glows and glitters : shattering glass , guns blazing , false-color shots from * inside * a gun as a round is chambered . sparks shoot as high-tension lines give when bodies fall on them . metal crumples as cars slam into each other , reflecting the moody green-and-yellow lighting in an underground parking garage . sunglasses glint . put simply , if you don't like movies where these things all figure in abundance , stay home . if you do , buy three copies . you'll wear them all out soon enough . chow and sorvino's characters do not like each other very much -- it's hard to like someone who seems to be responsible for getting your place torched -- but they form a mutual respect which is credible on-screen , and work together to get themselves out of trouble . there's also a good supporting role by michael rooker ( remember him from henry : portrait of a serial killer ? ) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the outside , and yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of jurgen prochnow . the replacement killers is all surface , but it's a wonderful surface to look at . good show all around . now let's see chow -- and fuqua -- in something a little more substantial . i * know * chow can handle it . 
 niagara niagara ( r )  ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . the series is strong for a lot of reasons . it's original ( though it has many ties to " the twilight zone " and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . 1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . actually , it's nice to see a risk at all . 
 ironically , what i was most excited about seeing in patch adams is what eventually left me feeling cheated by it in the end . after seeing the trailers , i knew i was going to get robin williams playing that lovably sensitive , extremely funny man , that shows people there's more to life . you know , the guy from dead poets society and good will hunting . i love that guy ; probably because he had truly inspired me before . and things were going so well for the first two-thirds of this movie too . until it was over and i thought to myself , " wait , i think i've seen this movie before . " in the end , my impression of patch adams is that is has some really funny scenes , and you can't help but fall in love with the guy when he's doing all of these great things , a lot of which you have probably seen in the trailers . and he has a lot to teach everyone he comes into contact with in the film . so throughout i'm thinking , " what a great guy ; i wish i was more like him . " which is always a good set-up . but it never follows through . the dramatic conclusion falls flat , and based on a true story or not , the plot points are a bit cliched . patch adams is a comedy , but more appropriately it would be classified as an inspirational film . and the hallmark of the inspirational film is that climactic scene at the end where the inspirational character takes a stand and is met by stiff consequences , but ultimately we realize that he made a difference . you see it in dead poets society in the " oh captain , my captain " scene . in patch adams though , it never comes . though patch does take an emotional stand at the end in a scene that tries to steal the emotion of a film like dead poets society , i don't know that we're convinced that he truly made a difference . he is a great guy , yes , but maybe not great enough .

's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) . where's joblo coming from ? the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 ) 
 dogma -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring linda fiorentino , matt damon , ben affleck , chris rock written and directed by kevin smith linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . it's a wild ride . they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . wings of desire this ain't . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . 
 if there has been a better comedy of errors this year than i'd reccomend it be shown with this delightful french import from the director of la cage aux folles . it could be a laugh all day film festival , because that's exactly what this movie is . what seems like the french " bean " turns out to be an even more hilarious romp . this movie will have you laughing for days after , and i'm glad i'm able to share this review with you . a man is on a train with francois pignon ( villeret ) when he begins to pull out pictures of different things he has built out of matches . guess how many matches it took ? he asks , 364 , 422 ! pierre is charmed , because he's found an idiot for his friend pierre brochant ( lhermitte . ) every wednesday they invite an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening . tonight it's his turn , and before now , he was idiotless . plus , this guy is in a class of his own . pierre cracks his back while playing golf , the doctor tells him not to go to the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop he attempts to go anyway . then his wife christine ( alexandra vandernoot ) decides to leave him for his cruelty for others . he thinks he's gone to the man he stole her from , then decides she's at a local love club . but in order get the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor . the idiot worsens pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back together with his wife . a complex plot is soon laid out in the household . another film from veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas . name one comedy that takes happens in one place , in a foreign language , and that is incredibly funny . one of the best parts about the dinner game ( besides that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film ) is the fact that while it's called the dinner game , there is no dinner or no game at all . the film's comedy owes almost everything to villeret , he's someone you can just look at and laugh . when the film is remade in the us ( with robin williams as the idiot ) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that is featured here . the supporting cast is good , but it's obvious who's in the center of attention . so , go see the dinner game while you can , this funny , original , and interesting french comedy gets  stars . 
 hollywood has a . 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . 
 apt pupil  -a review by bill chambers ( wchamber@netcom . ca ) ( visit my review archive , play some movie trivia , and more ! film freak central http : //www . geocities . com/~billchambers/ ) starring brad renfro , ian mckellan , elias koteas , david schwimmer screenplay by brandon boyce , based on the novella by stephen king directed by bryan singer " no man is an island , " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other things . bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . singer has yet to get keyser söze out of his system . his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the " right " or the " wrong " choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . 
 the happy bastard's 30-second review happy gilmore as a father ? of course ! that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . he's a hoot . directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . 
 floating life ( southern star - 1997 ) starring annette shun wah , annie yip , anthony wong , edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee , toby chan , toby wong screenplay by eddie ling-ching fong , clara law produced by bridget ikin directed by clara law running time : 95 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . -------------------------------------------------------------floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . the film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . ms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . however , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . 
 ( miramax - 1996 ) starring william baldwin , angela jones , bruce ramsay , mel gorham , lois chiles , daisy fuentes , barry corbin screenplay by john maass & reb braddock produced by john maass and raul puig directed by reb braddock running time : 94 minutes curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . to be specific , let me give you an example . do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . one particularly striking m . o . on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . no points for guessing what they do . her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . it's a great performance . reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . 
 for just a couple of years now , a certain film director has been doing for action films what marisa tomei did earlier this year for the " love interest " character in film--breathing life into it . if you've not guessed by now , the man i'm talking about is none other than john woo . the only problem is that mr . woo has been doing his thing over in japan , and not in the u . s . of a . woo's the killer had so much word of mouth in japan , that once the film arrived in the states in 1990 it was welcomed with a massive dose of critical praise . well , the wait is finally over . john woo is here , and his american debut goes the distance to prove that he is here to stay . the story is particularly simple : a vietnam vet is murdered by a group of trigger-happy hunters--partial to that race of human beings--and the man's daughter goes looking for him . it seems he was homeless , and to get the proper tour of her father's homeland , the daughter enlists the help of a down-and-out sailor named chance beaudreaux ( played by van damme ) . chance needs two-hundred bucks to ship out of new orleans , and figures that by taking this young and innocent woman up on her offer , he can get what he needs . to convince her that he's the man for the job , chance fights away some homeless thugs looking to rip natalie ( the daughter , played by yancy butler ) off of a few hundred dollars , using his fists and feet to crush bones like nothing you've ever seen in a van damme movie before . natalie is definitely convinced . she and chance soon discover that her father was murdered , and this leads them to cross paths with the leader of the afore-mentioned group ( played by lance henriksen ) . * and * we get another murder-of-a-homeless scene . the vet who's killed this time is someone chance knew as a friend , and--well , you can probably figure out the rest . the story * is * simple at heart , but it isn't really the story that's important here--it's the story * telling * . this is a dynamite action film . director john woo uses techniques--like slow-mo , quick-cut , and freeze frame--that other directors have either taken for granted or have been too afraid to use , and creates an entirely new kind of action movie that most american audiences have never seen before . it's exciting stuff , and it has a truly explosive impact to it ( especially in the climax , at an empty warehouse in the bayous ) . the characterizations * do * leave much to be desired--van damme has one grimacing expression plastered on his mug at all times ( does this guy * ever * smile . . . ? ) , and yancy butler doesn't have much to do here--but , again , these things are nothing more than serviceable to john woo's unique directorial style . he's a master at this kind of movie making . if you see hard target , but still want more woo , check out some of his earlier japanese work ( like the killer and hard boiled ) . these movies all have one thing in common : a superior artist at work . i can compare woo with quentin tarantino in that the two are fresh forces in hollywood who do not need or want to concede with any hollywood standards . target's ear-slicing scene had to be trimmed in order for the film to attain an r-rating . and perhaps that's saying something , too . woo has a little to learn about the united states as far as movies are concerned , and the mpaa and censorship . but it's far from too late , and if woo keeps up the good work he might even be able to break down the mpaa's standards on violence in the movies . 
 starring warren beatty , halle berry and oliver platt directed by warren beatty running time : 1 hour 40 minutes . warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) it's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . they're not cringe inducing , at least . the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . bulworth , then , is well worth watching . 
 starring denzel washington , john hannah , live schreiber , deborah kara unger , viscellous reon shannon , dan hedaya , harris yulin , david paymer , clancy brown , and rod steiger . directed by norman jewison written by armayan bernstein and dan gordon denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history . he is that amazing . the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids . " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in " shawshank redemption " ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 
 field of dreams almost defies description . although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : " if you build it , he will come . " then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . " if you build it , he will come . " and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates . and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to " ease his pain . " ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas . in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical . ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago " black sox " scandal . and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy . in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics . 
 drew barrymore has had a very good year . first , she did the wedding singer with adam sandler , and then she carried her own movie , ever after . both were huge winners at the box office . now she brings us home fries , a romantic comedy costarring catherine o'hara and luke wilson . luke wilson isn't the biggest name in hollywood or anything , but he is still a good actor . he and barrymore are dating in real life , after meeting on the set of this cute movie . barrymore stars as sally , a worker at a restaurant called burger matic . she is pregnant from the affair she had with a man named henry . henry's son , dorian ( luke wilson ) , and his other son , angus ( jake busey ) , accidentally kill their father by giving him a heart attack . their mother put them up to this because he had an affair with another woman . on the radio in the helicopter , they hear fast food workers on interference and figure that they know . so , dorian gets a job at burger matic , the same place where sally works , the woman who had an affair with his father . ok , right now , you are probably very lost , but so was i . as the movie goes on , dorian and sally fall in love , not knowing that sally is also in love with dorian's father . when dorian's mother ( catherine o'hara ) commands angus and dorian to kill sally , ( she finds out from pictures who the woman is ) dorian must stop them before the love of his life is killed . home fries has a very weird and original plot , not like any other movie i have ever seen . that really boosts a movie to a high level . drew barrymore gives an outstanding performance , her best since scream . this movie should boost luke wilson to a star level . catherine o'hara gives a very fake performance that was hard to believe . jake busey was very annoying and i wanted him to go away . shelley duvall did great , and you really believed how her character was feeling . home fries was also suspenseful in it's own way . i wanted certain things to happen and i couldn't tell if they were going to or not . there were a lot of laughs in home fries , but not crack up funny ones . home fries is a cute , small movie , which should make some pretty good money at the box office , but it wont be a blockbuster . it should keep some people just entertained . it is a very simple movie , nothing really complex about it ( except the plot ) . home fries was a really nice movie to watch on thanksgiving , and i enjoyed it a lot . 
 starring : gwyneth paltrow , john hannah , john lynch , jeanne tripplehorningredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition sliding doors is a love 'what if' story . the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . this leads to a life where helen moves out . helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . in story two , helen experiences a different fate . she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! " when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . there are minor inconveniences . since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ? 
 watching crash , the recurring thought that popped into my mind was `damn , i wonder how these people afford auto insurance . ' i mean , here we have a movie about people screwing like rabbits while at the same time crashing cars left and right . and , although crash's really made of a lot tougher stuff than the two of those , they constitute such a large amount of the plot and curious draw of this safe haven of sadomasochism that the producers used the quote `…sex and car crashes' ( ironically , from a review that blasts the film ) to advertise their celluloid psychosexual psychosis . leave it to me to be thinking of auto insurance rates , when a sexy actresses like deborah kara unger is going at it onscreen . crash is the story of james ballard ( james spader , picking his most interesting ( and perverse ) role since sex , lies , and videotape ) ) , a man who is living in a marriage with a primal curse : his wife , catherine ( deborah kara unger ) , cannot reach orgasm . she loves sex – her habits are downright nymphomaniacle and the marriage is open-ended – but nothing she can do can make her reach orgasm . her husband makes this both his personal quest and problem… the two wonder constantly about each other's sexual partners , go at it at least twice a day , and often have sex at the office . yet nothing's quite doing it for cathy . she's just not getting her big o . one day , while driving home from working on a car crash safety commercial , ballard has a head-on-collision with dr . helen remmington ( holly hunter ) . remmington's husband dies , flying through the windshield , and the last thing ballard witnesses before he passes out is remmington ripping open her shirt and proceeding to begin enjoying herself in the car . 
 every ant has his day . at least , that's what woody allen would have you think , in this twisted animated version of annie hall meets brazil . starting with a moody grass-scape of what turns out to be a quiet corner of central park , voiced-over by allen's `z' , a hapless worker ant who feels the weight of the colony--so to speak--on his back , antz tracks a lot like any allen flick . in fact , if it wasn't for all the forumla-driven bad guys , perilous situations , and narrow escapes , antz would be * exactly * like any other allen film . but this is animation , and that means kid-pleasing effects must plaster the screen . sadly , this hurts the story to the point where antz will quickly get lost in the shuffle of animated films coming out over the next year , despite its unique touches . to make matters worse , some of the more gruesome scenes , including an ant-termite battle that would leave private ryan wetting himself , are decidedly not for children . don't get me wrong , i thoroughly enjoyed the movie . and if the humdrum trailer for a bug's life is any indication , antz is going to be the best we'll see out of computer animation for awhile , at least until toy story 2 . but , to paraphrase z himself , a boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-changes-underlying-social-structure movie . . . just isn't that original . even if it is about ants . more story , less silly antics . maybe then i'll be inclined to put down my can of raid . . . . 
 directed by irwin winkler . cast : val kilmer , mira sorvino , kelly mcgillis , nathan lane , steven weber , bruce davison . 1999 - 128 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity and sexual situations ) . reviewed january 22 , 1999 . like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . on the basis of the overall story , " at first sight " is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , " awakenings . " what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . however , what helps " at first sight " rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer " you've got mail " immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual " love scenes , " and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the " big city . " the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . val kilmer , usually cast in the " macho " type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , " mighty aphrodite , " for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's " mimic , " 1998's " the replacement killers " ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with " at first sight " that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the " bad , " one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . the one misstep of " at first sight " is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . in " awakenings , " the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , " at first sight " comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . 
 shrek ( 2001 ) mike myers , eddie murphy , cameron diaz , john lithgow , vincent cassel . screenplay by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , roger s . h . schulman , based on the book by william steig . directed by andrew adamson , vicky jenson . 89 minutes . rated pg , 4 stars ( out of five stars ) review by ed johnson-ott , nuvo newsweekly www . nuvo . net archive reviews at http : //reviews . imdb . com/reviewsby ? edward + johnson-ott to receive reviews by e-mail at no charge , send subscription requests to ejohnsonott@prodigy . net or e-mail ejohnsonott-subscribe@onelist . com with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . all in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . but first the basics . based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way . all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! " ) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . the movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that'll do , donkey . that'll do " ) to " the graduate . " but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits – pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " – but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like " it's a small world . " which brings me to disturbing point number one . i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! put the past behind you ! there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . beyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . adding short jokes is simply mean . still , " shrek " is a rollicking good time . the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . to trot out a cliché , " shrek " is fun for all ages . parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . 
 " oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! " mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . " didn't i sound just like a mother ? " " you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly . " i know , but i still can't believe it . i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? " marty , you see , is a grown-up twin . although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb . the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . in this storm are two sane individuals . the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication . as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night . " we all have our secrets , " jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . this is a house filled with them . ( when lesly calls it the family's " home " to mrs . pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their " house . " ) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , " made for each other , " the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship . they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . director mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . " were you poor ? " jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . " did you eat pies ? chicken pot pies ? " " pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , " lesly replies with her usual sincerity . " a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , " jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . " are we entertaining royalty ? " with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . 
 no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! i can't stand this anymore ! ' . there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! event horizon is highly recommendedààbut at your own risk ! it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . 
 capsule : jackie chan teams up with his old buddy sammo hung to give us another zero-calorie fight-fest . gloriously foolish fun . my wife had this to say about mr . nice guy : " as entertainment , it's great . as a movie , it sucks . " i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought , the acting was hopeless , the script a throwaway . but it showcased jackie chan's raucous physical comedy -- " martial arts " is the wrong word for it -- and was therefore more than worth it . it isn't the all-out roar of joy that rumble in the bronx and especially supercop were , but it's still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda , and is all the better for it -- even if he's in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist who's just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence , and there's a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks , henchmen , cigar-smoking baddies , and cops . that's about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures , like his girlfriend ( miki lee ) and his female assistant , who have a howlingly funny scene that , due to language barriers , cannot be repeated here . some things you gotta see to believe . jackie's stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it : it's like play , or maybe a kind of dance . one scene has jackie getting into a fight in traffic -- on top of a flood of pepsi cans . another scene involves an unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and corridors . hung ( who directed ) plays it like an homage to the road runner and wile e . coyote cartoons . ( hung also films things a little more loosely and fluidly than staney tong did : we get a lot of steadicam work , lots of things going on in different sectors of the screen . ) another , even more mind-boggling scene , involves jackie being forced to fight with henchmen holding his limbs back with bungee cords . ( yes , he manages to get the upper hand with that one as well . don't ask how . ) the final scene gives us the grand guignol ( sans blood ) ending that a movie like this deserves . here's a hint : in the first five minutes , we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time , jackie was driving . 
 alien resurrection ( r )  ) 1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 
 for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . 
 from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go hoser ! ) director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " . 
 starring tom hanks , david morse , michael duncan , doug hutchinson , james cromwell , bonnie hunt , patricia clarkson , barry pepper , michael jeter , sam rockwell , graham greene , jeffrey demunn , dabbs greer , eve brent , harry dean stanton and gary sinise . it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . his pain creates pain for the viewer . however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . " the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . the speed in " the green mile " is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

" the faculty , " the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's " desperado " and 1996's " from dusk till dawn " ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's " scream " and 1997's " scream 2 " ) , is being called a cross between " invasion of the body snatchers " and " the breakfast club , " and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . the six characters , as in " the breakfast club , " can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . " the faculty " is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original " scream , " and rodriguez , whose " from dusk till dawn " is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . the plotline of " the faculty , " involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from " invasion of the body snatchers , " to " the puppet masters , " to " invaders from mars , " so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . the performances in " the faculty " were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( " t2 : judgement day " ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the " queen " alien , many of the faculty members disappear . it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , " the faculty " is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . - copyright 1998 by dustin putman dustin putman's film reviews  
 starring kirk douglas , william bendix , lee grantkirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking . " detective story " features one of kirk douglas's finest performances . he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in . the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . secrets i would not dream of giving away . with a name like " detective story " , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of " nypd blue " , but it doesn't quite work out that way . however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . the performances all around are fantastic . douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time . we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . which brings me back to douglas . he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father . how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these days : he's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . 
 easily the most anticipated , most delayed film release of 1997 , james cameron's $220 million " titanic " steams into theaters with a slew of questions to answer , most notably was it worth the wait , the hype , and all that money ? well . " titanic " is big , that's for sure . the size and scope of the production are evidenced by a massive , detailed replica of the white star liner , impressive visual effects , countless extras , and a love story transcending the atlantic ocean itself . that , plus the fact that the storyline is played out over three and a quarter hours , and we're talking epic proportions here . " titanic , " alas , doesn't quite live up to its promise or its much-ballyhooed pricetag . but it's an entertainment on a grand scale nonetheless . water-bound dramas are rarely without their production problems . cameron's own " the abyss " had its fair share , and those dogging " waterworld " ( prior to " titanic , " the most expensive movie in hollywood history ) are legendary . on " titanic , " it's clear that cameron the get-it-right-and-budget-be-damned director fairs far better than cameron the sounds-about-right screenwriter . while the ship sinks convincingly and spectacularly enough , leads leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet get saddled with lots of cornball situations and dialogue . cameron's trump card was to make " titanic " first and foremost a love story . however , his straightforward approach to that fateful night on april 15th , 1912 lends itself better to his visual overtures than his romantic undertones . dicaprio plays jack dawson , a freewheeling , penniless ( are there any other kind ? ) artist from steerage who's smitten by winslet's rose dewitt bukater , a stifled society damsel from the upper decks . cameron paints the haves and the have-nots a little too black and white--the rich are all stuffy , boring snots while the poor are the only ones who really know how to have fun--but on the darker side , billy zane is particularly good as rose's suave , callous fiancé cal hockley . of the innumerable versions of this ocean-going tragedy , this one might be the first to imply that the titanic hit the iceberg because its lookouts were distracted by a couple making out on deck . however , even at its epic length , " titanic " is never boring . time skips by quickly , and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy , including frances fisher ( as rose's disapproving mother ruth ) and bernard hill , in an underwritten role as the ship's ineffectual captain . perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film occurs during its present-day setup , when a rugged salvage expert ( played by bill " we're toast , man ! " paxton ) has one of his staff explain , via a fascinating computer animation , how the ship went down in the icy waters of the north atlantic , sending 1 , 500 of its 2 , 200 passengers and crew to their deaths . all this , of course , is represented in larger-than-life cameron-a-rama later in the film , when the tragedy of 1912 is stunningly recreated . at this point in " titanic , " dicaprio and winslet take a back seat to the spectacle and , like the rest of us , hang on for dear life . 
 the australian documentary the diplomat gives a nearly complete overview of the situation in east timor up to its august 1999 elections . it starts with the historical background of this small island's tribulations : since the 16th century until 1975 , the island was a portuguese colony . then , with the end of the portuguese revolution , east timor declared its independence and was immediately invaded by indonesia , its giant neighbor . the focus of the film is josé ramos horta , a political activist who represents the eastern timorese resistance historic leader , xanana gusmao , who was imprisoned in indonesia for a 20-year sentence . horta is a 1996 nobel prize winner who has been fighting for the independence of this little-known island for 24 years . the most compelling aspect of the film is its ability to convey how the tragic events of east timor and its desperate struggle for independence have been largely ignored by the world . since east timor has no army to support its claims for autonomy , horta says it must have been an act of god that his people had survived . horta's life is that of a peripatetic fighter who is exiled from the country the independence of which is his life mission . the challenge of horta's mission is accentuated by the fact that there is no unity among the leaders of east timor ; some of them are satisfied by living in a country annexed to its oppressors , others are adamant to fight for complete independence till the end . the film follows horta , almost always dog-tired , from one conference on the east timorese crisis to another and intersperses horta's diplomatic career with footage of hot events happening in east timor : president suharto resigns , habibie takes his place , nothing changes . indonesia itself has enough to worry about and when its economic crisis reaches the bottom of the barrel , indonesian foreign minister ali alatas is sent to deliver to the world promises of security and protection for east timor . while horta's mother , natalina , recollects how indonesian militia attacked her residence and took the lives of her children , the actual footage testifies the acts of barbaric genocide that took place on the island . the film hits all the appropriate strings by conveying how murder , torture , rape , all kinds of physical , sexual , and psychological violations have been the daily life of the people of east timor . it clearly exemplifies the frightening hypocrisy of the indonesian government which declares the crisis stable while more and more people are being brutally executed . unfortunately , up until the depiction of the 1999 democratic election in east timor , the film more or less plods along . it is only then that the film picks up the pace by showing that just four hours after the official announcement , the defeated militia gangs start to set east timor on fire . there is a moment of almost sublime irony when president bill clinton visits indonesia with the intention to stop the genocide and bring un peacekeeping forces to the country . he is greeted with a military ceremony that , in my opinion , signifies the irreconcilable difference between the east and the west . ironically , the portrait of josé ramos horta , an indefatigable fighter who broke the silence about east timor in the ( disinterested ) western press , doesn't come out as memorable or inspiring . unquestionably , the film is very effective and involving due to its subject matter , without a mawkish triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed . but what should have been a celebration of human tenacity comes out as an intelligent film , though with a somewhat insipid portrayal of its hero . 
 cast : dennis quaid , james caviezel , shawn doyle , elizabeth mitchell , andre braugher , noah emmerich written by : toby emmerich directed by : gregory hoblit running time : 117 minutes when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . such was the case with frequency . every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . it looked awful . it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . it looked like a flop . well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . frequency boasts a compelling story line . an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . including john's mother . this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ? yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense . most films are like that . don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .

 cast : pam grier , samuel l . jackson , robert forster , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , chris tucker director : quentin tarantino producer : lawrence bender screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the book rum punch by elmore leonard cinematography : guillermo navarro u . s . distributor : miramax films it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination – all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlighted as an " actor " with several decidedly unmemorable performances . now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts – an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . jackie brown's lone " innovation " is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn't exactly an original technique – it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's " banyon " ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds . soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . 
 with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , " wow . . . " like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien " phantoms . " whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a " zeus cannon , " dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a " wave " using eight collected " spirits " to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't . it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . why do these aliens feed on souls ? if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? what is so special about the " spirits " that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking . for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you're more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . there's no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . 
 eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . 
 there's good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that's chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have . you ain't never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( " heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . " ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is " be a man , " the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , " be a man " accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george " mr . sulu " takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , " alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ? " " well , there's mr . myagi . . . " " good . " " and mr . sulu . " " perfect . we've got ourselves a movie now .

 " high fidelity " ( 2000 )  directed by stephen frears written by d . v . devincentis , steve pink , john cusack , and scott michael rosenberg starring john cusack , iben hjejle , jack black , todd louiso , lisa bonet , catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor , joan cusack , natasha gregson wagner , and tim robbins just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . but these aren't any girlfriends…these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . the plot in three words is : women and music . the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . 
 after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . remember , the robot ? it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . " the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . " upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . " this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . " mate with her ! " spencer exclaims . " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . " the show has many funny twists . in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . oh , and eating is pretty funny too . spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * . when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully . 
 go -a review by bill chambers ( go@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring sarah polley , desmond askew , jay mohr , scott wolf screenplay by john august directed by doug liman go's is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive . a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier . in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go . but i digress . go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) . i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

 one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . mother-in-law jokes prevail . furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . this is what binds the movie together . joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . 
 the relaxed dude rides a roller coasterthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " . the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " . lebowski's passion is bowling . when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . even worse , they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . the kidnappers are impossibly inept . the dude and his cronies are even worse . every plan goes awry . you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " . the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement . the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket . he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes . a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was . " if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect " ? " when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling " ? maybe there's no real message . perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . maybe that's enough .
